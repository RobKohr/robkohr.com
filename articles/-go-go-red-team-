        <p>&quot;Go Go Red Team&quot;
&quot;Go Go Blue Team&quot;</p>
<p>Whatever side you are identified yourself with, you are identifying yourself with a side that supports an evil financial system, an imperialist military system, and a corrupt bought out political system controlled by career politicians who&#39;s main focus is getting enough campaign contributions to continually be reelected - often at the expense of your rights.</p>
<p>Stop applying a label to yourself and think freely. </p>
<p>The issues that both sides wheel out both have merit, and should be deeply considered regarding how we want our society to function. Look at the constitution and the bill of rights. The people who created these documents thought about issues that are still relevant today, and the dogma of the political parties are slowly washing away the soul of this nation.</p>
