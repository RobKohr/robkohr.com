I was reading this BGG page:</p>
<p><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4550/1000-blank-white-cards">https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4550/1000-blank-white-cards</a></p>
<p>And it looks like a fun game to play, especially with some jumbo index cards.</p>
<p>Some ideas for a good ruleset based on what I read in the forums:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the beginning of the first game, each player makes 6 cards and leave 4 blank cards. All cards get shuffled in. On subsequent games each player makes 4 cards, chooses 4 cards from archive, and also inserts 4 blank cards.</li>
<li>Each player draws 5 cards from the deck</li>
<li>The starting ruleset for the game is draw a card, play a card</li>
<li>If you have a blank card in your hand, you can turn it into a new card. New cards should have a name, a drawing, a type, and a description.

<li>The game ends when there is no cards left to draw</li>
<li>Each card is one of the following types:<ul>
<li><strong>action</strong> - do what it says and then discard it</li>
<li><strong>thing</strong> - modifies a player state (add/subtract from score score or giving a special ability). Place in front of you (keeper) or another player (giver)</li>
<li><strong>modifier</strong> can be played on things to change them - such as give them armor, make them bald, fast, green. Could change values of the card it is modifying</li>
<li><strong>new rule</strong> - change how the game is played</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Point values for things can range from -100 to +100</li>
<li>Actions are usually discarded after play</li>
<li>Cards can have suits (I am thinking colored stampers) and colors which makes it so they can be targeted by other cards.</li>
<li>No skip turn cards - seems to be the least fun cards</li>
</ul>
