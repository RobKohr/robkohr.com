<p>So I am 45, about to be 46. My father is 83. He is pretty far along with dementia, is in a VA home in Alabama, and nearly died, but that was due to being in a really bad state care facility prior that seemed to prefer to drug and leave their patients in a room to die rather than take care of the difficult ones. He recovered well, and is physically doing good, which ain&#39;t bad for having been on life support. He has been physically active his whole life, is strong, and I think that is part of the reason for his recovery.</p>
<p>So rounding back time to maybe about 75 for dad, and matching him to me, I have 30 good years left to do things before that downward slope to mortality. I have been aiming to be more physically fit: lift weights 2-3 times a week, run 2 times a week, and walk 4000 steps a day, and it shows. And aside from being more fit now, these are the things that correlate with a bonus of about +5 years of life, and probably a much slower downhill fall into old age weakness. </p>
<p>My father-in-law (well x-father-in-law) who had a serious sky diving crash and who didn&#39;t look like he was ever going to walk again, now is starting to walk with a walker, and I attribute that to the fact that he is fit and always lifting. </p>
<p>Strength training isn&#39;t so much for ascetics for me (I got all I need from my good looks with my beautiful wife) but sticking around and being someone my kids can look up to and their kids as well. I also keep myself interested in my millions of distractions and keep my brain as sharp as I can.</p>
