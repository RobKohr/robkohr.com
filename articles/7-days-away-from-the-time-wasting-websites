        <p>I have a problem with time wasting websites such as youtube, facebook, twitter, etc. I start going down rabbit holes that suck away my work day.</p>
<p>As such, I am putting all social media sites on a 7 day time out. I have added them all to my /etc/hosts file so that visiting them just goes to an error.</p>
<p>Also, installed the mac app called &quot;Time Out&quot; which every hour forces me to take a 10 minute break, during which I am allowing myself some time to work on my current task list, draw pictures, play piano, or write articles like this in my blog (the app covers the screen with a semi-transparent image making it so you can&#39;t click a mouse, but you can type, which is great a forcing what kind of things I can do).</p>
<p>The idea being that taking 10 minutes out of my day to unfocus from work will allow me to think a little more, and instead of distracting myself with social media, I can do something a little more meditative.</p>
