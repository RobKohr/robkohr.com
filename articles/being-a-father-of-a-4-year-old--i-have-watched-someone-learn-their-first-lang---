        <p>Being a father of a 4 year old, I have watched someone learn their first language. He really understands english very well, but he has shown me the many inconstancies and exceptions in our language. It would be great to use a survey of common &quot;mistakes&quot; a child makes in understanding the english language as a basis for how the language should be reshaped to make it more consistent.</p>
