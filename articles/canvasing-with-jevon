        <p>Jevon and I walked up 23rd ave and down 24th. It was great doing it with him as we could each hit one side of the street. We weren&#39;t knocking on doors, just putting card stock fliers under door mats. </p>
<p>It was a good day to do it, and he brought his bike so it was easy to get around. Eventually we started to run out of cards and didn&#39;t complete the loop, but we will continue tomorrow. </p>
<p>Later today I will be working on the boat with Scott.</p>
