        <p>Longview has an annual cardboard boat regatta, and I wanted to participate this year. </p>
<p>The theme was Christmas in July, and my daughter Chloe&#39;s favorite movie is Nightmare Before Christmas, so of course we had to do that. </p>
<p>I had my neighbor Scott and my son Jevon help with the construction.</p>

<p>My wife Tara made the most awesome paper mache zero:

<p>The boat ended up being over 16 feet long:

<p>And of course I had to surprise Chloe with being Jack the day of (this is actually ella in the picture).

<p>Chloe and me before boat launch:

<p>The boat ended up being too long and unstable (we had 4 adults and 2 kids in it). Amazingly we made it through two of the races, but ended up being dead last in the second race as the boat had a turn radius of about a mile, and on the second race, started to turn into a squishy accordion in the front.</p>
<p>Thankfully we were able to save Zero.
