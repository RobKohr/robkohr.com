        <p>One thing that I find that helps is to open up a text file and start typing what your thoughts are and be unfiltered (I sometimes look away from my screen so I don&#39;t proofread). Try and get everything out, and let yourself brainstorm.</p>
<p>Keeping it all in a conversation in your head creates too many threads to keep track of and you end up looping around worrying about this or that.
Then after that, I take the blob of text and try to organize it into categories such as &quot;issues to resolve&quot;, &quot;action items&quot;, â€¦ etc</p>
<p>Writing also slows down your thoughts a bit and keeps you from bouncing too much.</p>
<p>I also have a thing on my desk that I do rubber duck debugging with:

<p>I also turn this app on when I am trying to force myself to be productive:
<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/loud-typer/id1493508558?mt=12">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/loud-typer/id1493508558?mt=12</a></p>
<p>and this for music:

<p>The sound of the typing makes me feel more productive, which reinforces it, and the music gives me a rhythm.</p>
