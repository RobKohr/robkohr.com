        <p>I wiped out RobKohr.com as I haven&#39;t touched it in over 5 years, and replaced it with this blog. </p>
<p>It was built just using one long markdown file called blog.md that I edit in obsidian and each article is separated by ## Blog titles, and under that I use @date and @tags to specify those two values. Keeping with a brutalist design aesthetic, I render out those tags as well as the ## at the beginning of the headers. </p>
<p>The way it works is a build.js file that reads that file, splits it into separate articles, renders the md-&gt;html, applies some extra rendering and css, and spits them all out into a large collection of individual files. This makes for a very simple light weight site builder that is just serving static files. </p>
<p>Source code is here for those who want to do something similar:

<p>If you need any help getting it set up, let me know.</p>
