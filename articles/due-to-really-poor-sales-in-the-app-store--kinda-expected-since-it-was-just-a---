        <p>Due to really poor sales in the app store (kinda expected since it was just an astroids clone) space rocks is now free. When I get around to it, I will post up the source code on github. It was written with JS using the canvas element for drawing. It was bundled into an iOS app using phonegap.</p>
<p>If you have an urge to hack on it, just post a comment here, and I will post up the source earlier (right now it is a low priority).</p>
