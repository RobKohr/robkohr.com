        <p>Consistency is what I have been progressing more to. It helps to have lots of ideas and passion, but to do something big: build strength, learning a music instrument, run for office, build a side project, etc, requires doing something every day towards that goal in an endless way. I am actually doing all of those things right now, while raising kids and working full time.</p>
<p>To achieve it all - each thing needs 20-60 minutes per day to care and feed a goal to reach maturity.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t beat myself up though. I just have a daily checklist in a markdown textfile, and I can see how many I do each day and try to do them all. I frequently fail, but I try to get done what I can.</p>
