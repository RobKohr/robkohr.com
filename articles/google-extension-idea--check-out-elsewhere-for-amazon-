        <p><strong>Google Extension Idea: Check out elsewhere for amazon.</strong>
I use a chrome extension called &quot;the invisible hand&quot; which shows you what other online stores are charging in comparison to amazon. It would be great if there was an extension called &quot;check out elsewhere&quot; where your whole cart could be dropped onto one or more storefronts on the web for checkout elsewhere. </p>
<p>Why? </p>
<p>Well, amazon just like google has become the default for people to do one activity - shopping. There is a switching cost, and that is time; if I spend a lot more time shopping somewhere else I might figure out that that site is about equivalent to amazon, but it might not, so rather than investing the time, I stick with amazon. This would reduce the switching cost and prevent amazon from forming a solid monopoly on web commerce. </p>
<p>I am unlikely to build this myself, but I have made some chrome extensions in the past, so if you are a hacker who would like to take the lead on developing this, I could make a significant contribution (50% of development) to making this a reality. </p>
<p>If you have the urge, contact me, and we can make it happen, or just totally take the idea, and run with it yourself. That is cool by me :)</p>
