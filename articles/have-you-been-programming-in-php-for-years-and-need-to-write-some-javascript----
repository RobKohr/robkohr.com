Has been a great fill in for all those times I just wished I had access to the 1M+ functions php seems to have.</p>
<p>I like to wrap it all in an object so I can access something like:
php.explode(&#39;,&#39;, someString);</p>
<h2>and so it makes sense when the functions in javascript break the convention of camelCase names for php_functions. </h2>
<h2>For want of a nail the shoe was lost.
For want of a shoe the horse was lost.
For want of a horse the rider was lost.
For want of a rider the battle was lost.
For want of a battle the kingdom was lost.
And all for the want of a horseshoe nail.</h2>
