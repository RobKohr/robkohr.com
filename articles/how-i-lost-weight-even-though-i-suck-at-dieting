        <p>I am lazy and I hate calorie counting and I am not keen on having a limit on how much I eat a day.</p>
<p>I am pretty fit and strong, and lift weights regularly every week, but I had quite a bit of a gut, and was probably over 25% body fat. </p>
<p>I cut out drinks with sugar in them, eating after dinner, and in general just eating healthy meals with a focus on eating more proteins (protein pasta is great). </p>
<p>All this lowered my fat levels down to a reasonable level, but still left me with about 23% body fat and a bit of a belly, and that remained consistent. Trying to diet here and there and trim out things during the day didn&#39;t really cause any maintainable change.</p>
<p>Then I tried doing a 24 hour fast once a week. This really means just eating one dinner a little earlier (4:30pm) and then skipping breakfast and lunch and drinking water with electrolytes added. </p>
<p>With keeping the rest of the days calorie intake the same, I have shaved off consistently about 1 pound a week and 1/2&quot; from my waistline. </p>

Those are some nice trend-lines. :) Also, it seems my weight is fluctuating much less on a day-to-day basis. </p>
<p>This has been going for 5 weeks now, and I have gone from 23% to 19.7% based on Navy body fat formula.</p>
<p>What is great is I have no cravings or feelings that I am depriving myself except for the last 8 hrs of the weekly fast. The rest of the week, I eat well.</p>
<p>My plan is to bring myself down to 15% and then continuing to measure. If I get above 15% I fast that week, if I don&#39;t then I don&#39;t fast, so it basically becomes like a controllable throttle. Getting too low seems to have negative side effects, and 15% seems based on what I have read, to be a healthy limit. </p>
<p>A concern I had starting out on this was that eating and muscle growth go hand in hand, and it is hard to grow muscles when dieting. I have continued to lift the same number of days a week, but I just don&#39;t lift when I am fasting (don&#39;t want to over stress those muscles). So far, to my surprise, it seems I have broken through some plateaus on lifting, so my weight loss is mostly targeting fat and isn&#39;t hurting my lifting. One way to also see this is my waistline is shrinking faster than my weight, which is a good sign that the weight loss isn&#39;t hitting muscles hard. </p>
<p>But just on a feeling, I am feeling even stronger than before, and hitting even more personal records.</p>
