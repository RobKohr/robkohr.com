        <p>I am surprised it took people this long to strap a gun to a quadrocopter. Unfortunately, FPS is right. This is the future. Though I can see a person controlling a semi-autonomous squad of them rather than just a single one.</p>
<p>One would be the eyes of the operator, and with a mouse he could click multiple targets and the copters would swarm attack independently. He could then click on a map to have them move to the next zones of combat, and of course fly back to the recharge vehicle automatically when needed. </p>
<p>As with anything, there will be countermeasures. I am sure radio interference would be one of the first ones, hence the need for semi-autonomous operation. But I am sure, a signal will always get through. Targeting and destroying these little buggers will be a pain too, and it looks like they could be mass produced cheaply (and exploded rather than return for a recharge). In the end, you probably need to either cut off communications with the operator or eliminate the operator (if possible since this could be all the way across the world).</p>
<p>This technology is an obvious evolution of warfare, but I think more interesting will be the countermeasures.</p>
