<p>The actual samples of things the press actually show from the rejection list are things like math textbooks using &quot;What me, racist?&quot; and then having the student use racial bias data that is questionable to solve a problem. This is subtly pushing the racial focused narrative, and they are finding it in a huge number of textbooks, which clearly is a way of pushing a message into kids with a million little cuts.</p>
<p>The message may be right or wrong depending on your opinion, but even if right, it is wrong to try to indoctrinate a belief by sprinkling it throughout all coursework. That is propaganda and with the subtleness that they are doing it, brainwashing.</p>
<p>Also, note that the American Federation of Teachers president that shared a list of banned books retracted it, because the books were not actually banned and the information was fake.</p>
<p>This is much more nuanced, and there is a real problem that is being addressed. If conservatives were controlling education and trying to insert their message everywhere in subtle ways to little kids, wouldn&#39;t you feel pretty pissed off? It is tempting to indoctrinate the mass of future adults with your beliefs through little levers as they are a captive audience in the education system, but that is not a situation that should be abused for even righteous goals. Let them form their own opinions and just teach them the subject they are being taught.</p>
