        <p><a href="http://instaboardgame.com">Instaboardgame</a> will be a place for people to instantly play and create boardgames with their friends wherever they may be.</p>
<p>Think of it like a big box of board game pieces that you can pull out and start playing with.</p>
<p>To start with, you create a table, then you can either import in a prebuilt game, or you can
pull out pieces and drop them in, and you and others who have joined can start playing with them.</p>
<p>Only the table creator needs to have an account, and users can just join with the private share link that the creator provides.</p>
<p>Table creators can have up to one free table per account, and that table will maintain it&#39;s state for up to 1 week. If you have a subscription, you can have up to 5 tables and they will maintain their state for as long as you like. If you have a pro account, you can have up to 100 tables that you can manage, and you can set users to be admins of the tables. This is ideal for tournaments.</p>
