        <p>In WWI when tanks were being developed, they were first thought of landships. Kinda like a battleship that rolled on the land.</p>
<p>The Brits chose the rather commonplace name of tank to keep it a secret about what they were developing. &quot;Oh, this here we are making... oh it&#39;s just a tank. Nothing interesting, move along now&quot;. Eventually the fake name became the real name through common use.</p>
<p>I sometimes wish the name Landship stuck.</p>
<p>Looking at the bohemiths of WWI, they kinda would look like a ship flowing over the mud with port and starboard guns aiming out the sides. Here is a picture of one show using a banana (when it was not so ripe) for scale:
