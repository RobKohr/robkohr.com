        <p>Just remember it starts with Laby. </p>
<p>Just a word I gave up on trying to spell right long ago. I have never been a good speller, and I think I have a slight bit of dyslexia, so I never really saw the inner spelling of the word, but finally I just decided to split the word into pieces, and remember how the first part goes, and now it is easy :)</p>
<p>Anyway, I found this Labyrinth RPG game that is great for kids here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1916011551?psc=1&smid=A10N5GI8B3O43K&ref_=chk_typ_imgToDp">https://www.amazon.com/dp/1916011551?psc=1&amp;smid=A10N5GI8B3O43K&amp;ref_=chk_typ_imgToDp</a></p>
<p>and I am going to watch the movie of it with them, and then surprise them with the game.</p>
<p>Reading through the game, it sounds like it would make a great video game/VR experience.</p>
