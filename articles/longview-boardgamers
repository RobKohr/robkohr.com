<h3>Updates:</h3>
<h4>June 1st 2024 We&#39;ve moved</h4>
<p>After having boardgames at Union Square for the last couple years, we decided to change locations. Though the location was great, their reduced Saturday hours, leading to the closing up at 9pm last month, means that it just doesn&#39;t work for us anymore. </p>
<p>Our new home is at the Regent Chinese Restaurant &amp; Bar at:
3353 Washington Way, Longview, WA 98632</p>
<p>They have a bar which is pretty popular, and are open till late at night, and even keep cooking pretty late so we can get some yummy Chinese food. </p>
<p>When you pull in, enter the building on the left where the bar is, proceed past the bar, and in the billiard room, there is door on the left which leads to a room which the entertainment director has set up for us to play.</p>
<p>We will be keeping the time the same: 9pm the first Saturday of the month (AKA tomorrow :) ) </p>
<p>See you all there. </p>
