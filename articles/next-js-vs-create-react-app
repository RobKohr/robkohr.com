        <p>When doing react, I have on worked with CRA up until now. I just took over a next.js app, and when built and deployed, it is speedy, but didn&#39;t like some of the details of development:</p>
<ul>
<li>myApp/pages/page-name/index.js is how you create a route for /page-name. While quick and friendly, I prefer the following:<ul>
<li>Defining my own route rules in details with reach-router. I am just to particular about routing to accept the trade off of simplicity against customizability. Also, defining routes is simple, and it is good for rearranging things without renaming components.</li>
<li>I really don&#39;t like dozens of index.js files in my codebase. I prefer to call pages pages/page-name/page-name.js so it is clear by the file name what things are for.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>making changes when development are a little fluky when it comes to live updates, css doesn&#39;t seem to live update nicely, and there are just too many times that I have to kill the server and restart it to see my changes. This is even worse because it all seems unpredictable as to if/when changes would appear and a little frustrating</li>
</ul>
<p>These are little nitpicks, and if CRA didn&#39;t exist, I would go with next, but I love the way CRA is more customizable regarding routing, and is just snappy for responsiveness. I also feel there is just too much gray area as to if something is being rendered on the server or the client, and as an ex-apache/php guy, I really am not a fan of worrying about server side rendering anymore.</p>
<p>The case where I would likely use next would be if I were building a static content based site where SEO and first page load times were everything. I also know gatsby is supposed to be good for this too, so I would do some side by side comparisons. Also SEO with react is pretty good as is.</p>
<p>In the end though, that isn&#39;t really something I do much of, so I&#39;ll be on CRA for the forseeable future.</p>
