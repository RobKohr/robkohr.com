        <p>My mind gets such a buzz from taking an idea and spinning it into the concept for a game and then making it so (the last part being so ardurious that it rarely comes into being). This fun open ended thought process that then needs to be rangled by the realities of time and effort to actually make it real, and if you don&#39;t wrangle it well enough, and commit hard enough, it just gets stacked on the bin of ideas that never see the light of day (which is surprising considering that that hill is taller than any mountain in the known universe).</p>
<p>I love the work that I do, but hell if I wouldn&#39;t love to be just making my income making games instead... but for myself, not working at a game company. That sounds about as much fun as loving donuts and getting hired at a donut factory.</p>
