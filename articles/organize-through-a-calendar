        <p>I have tried a bunch of task list management methods, and I am going to try a new one. </p>
<p>On my work calendar app, I created a new calendar where events get a light blue color. I have some repeating events on there that I want to do every day: working out, playing violin, working on individual projects, eating lunch (yep, even that basic). I then add whatever other things I need to do from my task list, and give them a time that I will work on them. </p>
<p>At the end of the day, anything done gets deleted, and anything not done gets moved forward, and I try to move it forward to a time I feel I realistically can do it. </p>
<p>When I look back on the week, I should see no light blue events. </p>
<p>We&#39;ll see how it works</p>
