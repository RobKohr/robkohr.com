        <p>&quot;This is what I constantly tell my students: The <em>hard</em> part about doing a tech product for the most part isn&#39;t the what beginners <em>think</em> makes tech hard â€” the hard part is wrangling systemic complexity in a good, sustainable and reliable way.</p>
<p>Many non-tech people e.g. look at programmers and think the hard part is knowing what this garble of weird text means. But this is the easy part. And if you are a person who would think it is hard, you probably don&#39;t know about all the demons out there that will come to haunt you if you don&#39;t build a foundation that helps you actively keeping them away.&quot;</p>
