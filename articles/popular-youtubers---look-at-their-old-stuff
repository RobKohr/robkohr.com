        <p>I kinda love going to a popular youtuber&#39;s channel, going to their videos section, and sorting by oldest. </p>
<p>What is now a polished producer of content that makes you feel intimidated to even attempt to make videos was once someone with a crappy camera, shooting in their back yard with a bad audio setup. </p>
<p>Everyone had to learn to walk before they could run. Whatever you do, that you are doing bad and are discouraged, know that failing is just the first step on the long road to greatness (or the medium length road to goodness if you don&#39;t want to overcommit yourself). </p>
<p>It isn&#39;t that you lack an innate gift that others have, it is simply that you haven&#39;t put in the focused effort over time to achieve. Just keep on grinding and leveling up, because remember, everyone sucked at first.</p>
