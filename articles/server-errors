        <p>There have been a lot of server errors recently, and they are the result of system resources being overwhelmed (using up system memory and processor).</p>
<p>I suspect that this is due to another app I have been working on - a real time web game called constantsail.com.</p>
<p>I am now setting up a separate server for the that game so that it&#39;s performance does not effect editthis.info. I expect it will be set up within the next 48 hours, and hopefully this resolves the issues.</p>
<p>Thanks,
Rob</p>
<p>Update</p>
<p>This problem has been resolved and you should not see any more server errors relating to this problem. The app has been moved to another server.</p>
