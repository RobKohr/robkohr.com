        <p>So someone sent a DMCA notice to my service provider. They were complaining about content that they considered their copyright in a wiki I am hosting. It was a page about their news station WHKY TV. Looking through the history of the page, I could see that a bunch of people worked together to create the page. </p>
<p>After a bunch of back and forth messages where he took a week to reply each time (and capped off each one with a legal threat), my final message to them ended with:</p>
<p>&quot;Also, reply within 24 hours. I don&#39;t care how busy you are. You are
the one who is wasting my time with what I suspect is a fishing
expedition then threatening legal action. All the while I am complying
with the investigation clause in your request.</p>
<p>Cheers,
Rob&quot;
I hate DMCA lawyers. It would be great if there was some recourse for BS claims.</p>
