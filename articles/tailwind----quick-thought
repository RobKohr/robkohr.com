        <p>Look at a bunch of tailwind videos, and thought about how I code to see if the two would be compatiable.</p>
<p>Typically I make React components, and I give a class name to the top level of the react component. So, UserProfileCard would have the class .user-profile-card-component.</p>
<p>Then, I create a .scss file where that is the parent class and everything else is a child. I set all the styling for the component in there.</p>
<p>Anything that is a common thing, such as .card, I would put in main.scss, or site.scss or something like that.</p>
<p>Anything that defined colors, shadowing, sizing, etc, would go in the variables.scss file. </p>
<p>With all that, I like what I have. Generic chunks that get reused between components (like .card), some specifications, and a bit of component specific tailored styling. </p>
<p>Now looking at the little animated image demoing use of it on the tailwindcss.com website, I just can&#39;t see why I would want to use that for styling a component. </p>
<p><img src="images/Pasted image 20241215105219.png" alt="Pasted image 20241215105219.png" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>I would probably set something like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">.quote-card-component{
    .card{
        display:flex;
        .side-image.left{
           
        }
        .text-content{
            blockquote{
            }
            .person-label{
                .name{
                    &amp;a{
                        
                    }
                }
                .title{
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>with all the relevant styling thrown in. </p>
<p>When I want to tweak this later, it is easy to find and change things. Also, plenty of this stuff could be generalized out of the quote-card-component, but it can also live in there until it needs to be reused elsewhere and then brought up to the global scope for a reused style.</p>
<p>For example, I would totally have card be put on the actual parent component element, and I wouldn&#39;t need to style the name&#39;s a tag here. </p>
<p>This isn&#39;t to rain too much on other&#39;s parade&#39;s. I think using tailwind is just as valid as putting inline css in style attributes on html elements. I do it once in a while as a one off, and having a library that makes that inline stuff more compressed is nice.</p>
<p>My main issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>With separated css though, you can think about what you are using where, and be able to grab and reuse and rename and tweak them easier. </li>
<li>I can read style sheets much better than <code>max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 md:px-8 mt-20 sm:mt-24 lg:mt-32 lg:grid lg:gap-8 lg:grid-cols-12 lg:items-center</code> (actually copied from the html on tailwind&#39;s website)</li>
<li>Whatever marginal gains there are, I don&#39;t see the worth in implementing and learning tailwind to achieve it. </li>
<li>I like nameing things. Yep, it is hard, but when I see a deep structure of html with no class names or ids on the elements, it is hard to think of the thought process that went into this structure. With names, I get the semantic meaning of what things are rather than just a tree of nested unnamed divs. <ul>
<li>This is part of my issue with react libraries that generate random class names. When I am inspecting it in the browser, I want to know what I am selecting.</li>
<li>People seem to worry a lot about css name collisions. This is why everything that is particular for a component, I put under that component&#39;s class name. As such, I never have any conflicts. The only thing that might conflict is in main.css, but I don&#39;t add anything that isn&#39;t heavily being reused there, and it is all kept pretty basic.</li>
</ul>
