        <p>I started doing a slight tweak to my workout routine. </p>
<p>I do 1 set per exercise, and push to do 20 reps of that set. If I don&#39;t make it, I rest for 30 seconds and try to squeeze out some more, and repeat until I hit 20 with minimal rest.  </p>
<p>I write down the weight and the number of reps of my first failure. When I can make it to 20 reps without failure, then the next workout I up the weight. It works really well, and I can do a full body workout in under 45 minutes and get great gains thanks to really tapping out each muscle group.  </p>
<p>Doing heaver weights and less reps tends to cause more injuries for me (I am 46) and I always found I had plenty of gas still in the tank when I did drop sets, so I knew I wasn&#39;t really reaching my limit. This makes it so I can reach my limit without having to pull off plates and do lots of sets. It also gives an clear goal - 20 reps every time, even if you have to take mini breaks.</p>
<p>Research has shown that number of reps is not really that important to muscle growth - what is important is pushing to failure, and this seems to really get me to that failure. If I can&#39;t even do another rep at what should be a fraction of my 1 rep max, then I know that I have reached true failure. </p>
<h3>Update 2024-05-31</h3>
<p>Well, I started hitting walls with 20 reps for arms. It just is hard to get to 20 at the limits of what my arms can do, but using rep/weight calculations of the higher amount for 15 reps, I am able to achieve and upgrade my weights, even when I have been stuck for weeks at the limits of what I can do at 20. </p>
<p>This only seems to apply to arms though. Legs and back seem to adapt just fine to upping weight at 20 reps, and haven&#39;t had problems there. My theory is that large muscles have a higher ability for long term stress. The little biceps and triceps just can&#39;t keep going.</p>
