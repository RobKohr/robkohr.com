<p>Go to an open mic night for comedians and musicians. Go to a student art show. Go to a skate park.</p>
<p>Go listen to 10000 hours by macklemore (not the Justin Bieber song... Different meaning there)   </p>
<p>The ability to create is a learned skill that comes from lots of grinding. Even a child learning to talk goes through the same learning path. And yep after 5 years of intense learning they can have a conversation with you. By 8 or 9 they start to get deep and philosophical and are spreading their wings and their learning takes them on new journeys as they become readers. </p>
<p>Look at many fields of creative endeavors and you will see a similar flight past. </p>
<p>This is why their are so many armchair creators commenting on how they could do just as well if they tried, and when they do put forth the effort they realize after a year or two they just got to the foothills of the mountain and can actually see the climb in front of them. </p>
<p>This is what in is called the valley of dispair. </p>
<p>This is where a lot of creatives throw in the towel. They suddenly see how hard it is to move on to the next level. This valley swallows most of us whole as we abandon the quest to greatness.</p>
<p>But those who grit their teeth and push on to the 10 thousand hours are the ones who became masters in their craft.</p>
<p>I love on YouTube you can go to any channels about page, and go to videos, and sort by oldest. Some clean out their earlier failures, but most don&#39;t. Find the most polished and successful YouTuber, and look at the crap they made for the first few years. Or the first songs of hit song writers. Or the videos famous directors made in film school. Or the first few games famous indie game devs churned out. </p>
<p>The mastery of any craft follows a similar pathway every time and if you have been struggling and felt like you have been getting good, but then realize that you hit the valley of dispair, just realize you have made it past where 80% of people have gone. And now you are at the part that consumes the 80% of those whole made it to that point. Now is the time to summon that will to climb the mountain before you and become the master. Show us what you got.</p>
