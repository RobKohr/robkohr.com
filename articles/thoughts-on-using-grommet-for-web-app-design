        <p>I used <a href="https://icons.grommet.io/">Grommet</a> for a react project, and here are some of my thoughts on it.</p>
<p>Things I like</p>
<ul>
<li>Works out of the box for most use cases</li>
<li>Nice for form elements</li>
<li>Gives a standard look and feel for the site without any need to work out details</li>
</ul>
<p>Things I don&#39;t like</p>
<ul>
<li>A grommet element is a wrapper for an entire dom structure that you can&#39;t directly style as it doesn&#39;t have any classes you can apply css to; a simple parent classname that you can have as a starting point would work wonders</li>
<li>The Box wrapper and other wrappers for grid layouts just reimplement html features but in a more limited and difficult to adjust way</li>
<li>It basically sucks for doing anything new stylistically (such as building a static landing page).</li>
<li>It&#39;s design is kinda bla and minimal as far as customization</li>
</ul>
<p>If I were to do a application in the future I would:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#39;d still use grommet for all of its components, but not it&#39;s layout</li>
<li>Create a thin layer interface over grommet that just passes down props. This way a mvp can be quickly pushable, but the styles would be easily updatable<ul>
<li>But more likely, unless styles don&#39;t matter at all, I would just do my own component library based on mocks as really stying components isn&#39;t too hard</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Well structured scss is really easy to manage, and while grommet is good for building quick and dirty UI, scss custom built ui components are better to build for a project that is going to be something that will be used for a long term project.</p>
