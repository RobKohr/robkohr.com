        <p>So, Truecrypt posted that they are no longer secure anymore and you can no longer download their software and ... oh yeah, you should start using Microsoft&#39;s Bitlocker instead. Never mind that it is closed source and that MS promises that they won&#39;t put in a back door for the NSA.</p>
<p>The nice thing about open source software is that you don&#39;t have to trust them when they say they aren&#39;t going to put in a back door. </p>
<p>It all seems pretty shady, but I have a lot of hope that some fork (perhaps <a href="http://truecrypt.ch">http://truecrypt.ch</a>) will do a reasonable job of maintaining the project. Especially since TrueCrypt has passed most audits. </p>
<p>Trust MS to encrypt my volumes... yeah, that is not happening.</p>
