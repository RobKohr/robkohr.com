        <p>Well, I started hitting walls with 20 reps for arms. It just is hard to get to 20 at the limits of what my arms can do, but using rep/weight calculations of the higher amount for 15 reps, I am able to achieve and upgrade my weights, even when I have been stuck for weeks at the limits of what I can do at 20. </p>
<p>This only seems to apply to arms though. Legs and back seem to adapt just fine to upping weight at 20 reps, and haven&#39;t had problems there. My theory is that large muscles have a higher ability for long term stress. The little biceps and triceps just can&#39;t keep going.</p>
