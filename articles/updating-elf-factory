<p>So I built Elf Factory initially when I didn&#39;t have a playdate, and created some tiny fonts to make it so a decent amount of text could appear on the screen.</p>
<p>That looked great on my computer monitor, but apparently not so much on the playdate.</p>
<p>Now that I have one in hand, I was able to tweak all the fonts to make them readable, and to some editing to make it so all the needed text appears on the screen, and it looks pretty great. I also updated the menu card for the game to look a little better and more festive.</p>
<p>The game is a speed puzzle game where you have to assemble presents from parts that are stacked on top of each other so that you can save Christmas:</p>
