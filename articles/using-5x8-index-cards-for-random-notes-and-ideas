        <p>I started working with using index cards for writing ideas similar to the slipcard (Zettelkasten Method). I started working with 3x5&#39;s but found they were too small to write ideas on. Now I am using 5x8&#39;s. This works well, because I use them in portrait orientation and they fit in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XZ3B7F2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1">box I got for them</a>. I also got some <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0784FP7BW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1">heavy duty cards</a> that stand up well in the box and are nice to write on.</p>
<p>Here is the first card in the box. Instead of using it as an index, I am using the first one as a list of ideas for what cards could be; this is helpful as it is always the card that is visible in front of the stack.</p>

<p>So far I have made about 15-20 cards, and most are ending up under number 4 (following the system, things under 4 would be 4a, 4b, ...etc) which is where software ideas go. I don&#39;t know if this is a great choice compared to always tacking a new idea or concept at the end of the stack. The downside might be that I am always inserting most of the cards at that point as most of my ideas are software ideas. The upside is that I can have them always together so I can flip through them to see what I wanna work on next.</p>
