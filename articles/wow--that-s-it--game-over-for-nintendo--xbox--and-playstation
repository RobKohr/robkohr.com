        <p>Wow, that&#39;s it. Game over for Nintendo, XBox, and playstation. It is so easy to make a game on android and put it on this store, consoles and their gated developer communities don&#39;t stand a chance. </p>
<p>There have been a few android game consoles that were made by small firms and a bunch that were in &quot;pre-launch&quot; phases, but now the big boy has come to the table. I am going to have to re-install unity 3d and try and get something built quickly.</p>
