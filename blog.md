## Working on Pivotal Tracker replacement

@tags=tracker, software, projects

Pivotal tracker is one of my favorite apps, and it looks like it is getting shut down. As such, I am looking to build a similar tracker software to fill this niche. 



## Barbell Strategies
@date=2024-08-28
@tags=self-improvement

Barbell strategy means to do two absolute different things to extremes rather than two middling things.

It comes from investing where you invest half in high risk/reward stocks, and half in risk free assets rather than just average stocks.

Some real life, non-financial examples:

- Read a challenging hard book and a soft book.
- Exercise or diet hard one day, and do the opposite the following day.
- Spend a week doing an intensive educational course, and then spend the next month applying your knowledge.

A more detailed description and more examples are at:

## Cat Litter Parallel Universe Machine
@date=2024-08-16
@tags=dreams, scifi, time-travel

This came from a dream, I have cats, just changed the litters before bed, and I love the movie Hot Tub Time Machine.

In the dream, me and a bunch of friends discover that a cat litter box can send you to a parallel universe (it might have also possibly traveled through time a bit). 

This presented an interesting problem. If you go to another parallel universe, how do you know, and also, how will you know if you got back to your original universe. And maybe you wanna find out about some other things about different parallel universes. 

Let's say there are 5 friends, A, B, C, D, E. You are person A, the finder of the great discovery. 

Tell your friends to order themselves in whatever order they like, with you at the head of the line. Taking an index card in landscape orientation, draw lines to make three rows. In the the middle row, make 5 columns and have each person write their names at the tops of the columns in the order they are in the line. Take a die, and roll it, and write your number under your name, and have each person do the same in order. People should write their own so that it is in their handwriting. 

At the top of the card, write "Machine". Also circle your name to indicate that you were the one who decided to create this method. 

Now, have everyone take a separate card and copy everything from the original card, except, write their name on the top of the card instead of "Machine." This will be their parallel universe passport. The numbers from the dice will be the identifying number for this universe. On the back of their card, on individual lines they would write the numbers of each universe they visit.

Going through the litter box machine to another dimension might reveal a set of interesting things:
- Would the randomness of the dice make it so each universe was different
- Would the order of the people be different or would they be random and based on the whim of the person in that universe
- Would the creator of the card be different
- If you set through the machine, would the you in the other dimension be there too, or would they swap places with you, or would it create a cascade of you's stepping through the portal through the multiverse so there would just be one you in each universe
- If that is true, then what would happen if you roll a die to see who goes through the portal.

I am assuming with all this that universes that you get to would be nearly identical to yours, but still randomness would happen with a dice roll that would create different ID numbers at the time before you enter the machine. 

I wonder if the machine would take you to only a universe that is nearly identical to yours, but only different a second before you enter the machine. Perhaps the split would happen after you create the IDs ... so you might want to create the IDs as close to when you step through the portal as possible. A lot of universe splitting might happen over the course of an hour. 

The dream didn't have any conclusions for any of this. I did come to one conclusion though. Parallel Universe Machine doesn't roll of the tongue the same way Time Machine Does. Just a lot of syllables there. 


## Organize Through a calendar
@date=2024-08-14
@tags=productivity

I have tried a bunch of task list management methods, and I am going to try a new one. 

On my work calendar app, I created a new calendar where events get a light blue color. I have some repeating events on there that I want to do every day: working out, playing violin, working on individual projects, eating lunch (yep, even that basic). I then add whatever other things I need to do from my task list, and give them a time that I will work on them. 

At the end of the day, anything done gets deleted, and anything not done gets moved forward, and I try to move it forward to a time I feel I realistically can do it. 

When I look back on the week, I should see no light blue events. 

We'll see how it works

## Firefox in all things
@date=2024-08-14
@tags=tech

Chrome and Edge really dominate the tech landscape. At work, I use Firefox as I like to support something different, and even though my company says only Chrome is supported for our customers, I like that when I am developing, and seeing compatibility bugs, I am fixing them for Firefox users so that we don't continue to enforce the monopoly of Google. 

## Focus & Learning 
@date=2024-08-14
@tags=learning, productivity

I wonder how many different subjects and skills you can learn at the same time - during a week, not simultaneously - and still progress in them. Like if you spend 30-60 minutes a day on one skill, take a rest, and then do the same thing with another skill, and so on, what would happen over the course of a year.

## Update to "Tapping out at 20 reps"
@date=2024-05-31
@tags=exercise

Well, I started hitting walls with 20 reps for arms. It just is hard to get to 20 at the limits of what my arms can do, but using rep/weight calculations of the higher amount for 15 reps, I am able to achieve and upgrade my weights, even when I have been stuck for weeks at the limits of what I can do at 20. 

This only seems to apply to arms though. Legs and back seem to adapt just fine to upping weight at 20 reps, and haven't had problems there. My theory is that large muscles have a higher ability for long term stress. The little biceps and triceps just can't keep going. 

## Music has become a zero-sum game
@date=2024-05-31
@tags=economics, music

Musicians used to make money via album sales (records, tapes, cds, mp3s, etc). This is how they exploded financially by selling millions of copies.

Today we have streaming, such as Spotify, as the main avenue to make money as a musician. This is a very different economic situation.

In the initial situation, if a consumer bought 10 albums in a year, and they find some new album they want to listen to, they would buy that one. For simplicity lets say every album is $10, so that makes them go from $100 to $110 purchases in a year. Some consumers really like music, and they would buy a lot more than others, and some musicians are really great, and create something that people value enough to buy an additional album during a year.

For streaming, let's say that a subscription is $100 per year. That money is parceled out to the musicians you listen to based upon how much you listen to them. But that money is capped, and everyone pays the same, so the market pushes that subscription price to something below what the average value is for everyone, so that the most of the market can be attracted to pay for the subscription. 

This all means that there is a maximum amount of value in the market for musicians. You can't get a person to purchase an additional album as they have a subscription, and will just listen to it there. When someone listens to your album, you get a bit of that pie, and that is a bit some other musician doesn't get. Even if you are the greatest musician of all time, the most you can get is the whole pie if the consumer only listens to your music. 

This creates a ceiling on what the sum total of all revenue all musicians can make is. Add more musicians, and they all just eat away at each other's income.

I like digging deep into Spotify and finding things no one listens to. Stuff with less than 1000 listens a month... and surprisingly there is a lot of good things. If you figure they make about $0.004 cents per stream, they make about $4 a month (minus Spotify's cut and fees and such). 

Now the music industry has always been a brutal hockey stick shaped curve where the top 0.001% really earn most of the money, but that most of the money has a cap now.

I guess the question is, would those people who pay for streaming now, be buying more music without the existence of streaming and how much does streaming help one set of musicians over another. 

Weird Al complains he makes no money on Spotify, and I figure that compares to what he used to make in record sales. It makes sense though, as he is someone I love, and owned music from, and even seen live, but I couldn't imagine listing to Amish Paradise in the background on repeat. 

This is a really stark example, but I can see that would be lots of other distortions that probably happen, some more positive. Spotify makes it easy to explore and listen to music you might not ever consider purchasing, and personally, I go exploring weird things that would never be found normally.

So, maybe this should all be thought of another way. The big mainstream has been capped as far as how much money they can extract, but now the little guy making sea shanty songs that reach a thousand users a month and make $4. He'll barely be able to buy a coffee with that, but hell, now he is a professional musician, and we are all the better because that long tail of the hockey stick has stuff we would never be exposed to if it wasn't for streaming.

Of course, musicians still make money from album sales and performances, and it seems the big names from my youth are still out there touring, riding that nostalgia train. They will occasionally get me or those from my generation to buy some pricy ticketmaster tickets, but the future is fighting for the limited pie that is the listener's ears, and I tend to throw my pie all over the place.


## Sometimes

Sometimes I have so many things to do in a day, that it is hard to move forward on some things I want to do. Needs trumping wants.

Today I got finished with the garden. I planted some starts I did in little trays the weekend before last, but they were all looking rather sickly, so I went through and put new seeds in all of the holes in the garden. 


## Returning to Feudalism after capitalism fails
@date=2024-03-29
@tags=capitalism

This was inspired by this article:
https://crookedtimber.org/2024/03/25/capitalism-is-dead-long-live-capital/

Through the weaving of all forms of capitalism through large entities that perform rent seeking behavior, we have turned ourselves into pesants working the land of our lord. Nearly companies now use amazon cloud as their data system backend. We funnel all of our communication and connections through social media. All of our shopping is done via platforms that stand between the buyer and seller and take a large cut of the revenue. Our music, apps, and media all give a 30% cut to a handful of big tech companies. It is all controlled by a few: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google - aptly called FAANG. They know all that you do, they control what you see, and they are the middle man in all transactions, even in the background when you don't see them there. They control your authenticated access to the sites you visit. They are your way of paying for things.

Netflix is probably the most beign of them all, and I include it just because it it typically rapped up in the FAANG acronym, but they seem to be souly focused on just being a streaming video provider, and even they are feudal slaves to the rest of FAANG as they are primarily powered by AWS on the backend. 

Webtech and non-webtech companies that use webtech need to go back to their roots, and throw off the cloud provider shackles. Spin up some VPSs, or even get some dedicated hosting and start running on linux boxes using open source tools that aren't rented from them. Don't make google & facebook the default method for single sign on. Don't stick analytics and social code in your website. 

All of these services that these big companies provide have the some formula to suck companies into using them: It is cheap or free to startup with, you don't need to hire any sysadmins (though aws admins are now a thing), and then the price goes up quickly with use, and they charge large prices to get your data back from them to leave the service. 

There are other types of fuedelism that are growing: Banks have merged and are backed by your dollars by the government since they made themselves too big to fail, the govt has become more of the lord of college graduates with student loans that keep growing, and over health insurance as they control the markets more. 

There are likely other things, but the concentration of wealth by large entities, and the power they gain to keep anyone that is not massive out of the market is destroying capitalism. We need a constant influx of scrappy companies having big growth, and we need at the same time a constant flow of huge dusty companies falling to shambles. Our systems are leading more to permeant mega control by entrenched powers. 



## Why Generative AI Violates Copyright - for skeptics
@date=2024-03-06
@tags=ai

There is a thread of thought about AI, that it isn't violating copyright, because, just like humans, it is just synthesizing new works from it's learning. 

I was a little on the fence about this, but after a bit of mental wanderings, I side hard on the side that it is violating copyright. To get you there, let me take you on a 

### A journey

When it is dark at night, and there is a tree in the window or a coat on a hat rack, but see a human there, we are riding on our instinct to see people in the shadow. When looking at a grain of wood or a spill of mustard, and see faces in the shapes, it is that instinct that is striking again. We are always searching and improperly identifying the other that isn't there.

### AI apocalypse coming? 

Sam Altman runs an AI company.

He never shuts up about how much we need to fear the coming AI apocalypse and how the government needs to regulate it and make him and other large companies be the stewards of AI so that the world can remain safe and we don't end up with Skynet.

Sounds like he is using regulation to secure a monopoly on his amazing product.

Nope. 

### We are just seeing what the magician wants us to see. 

His AI gives us the illusion of close to human level intelligence the same way we see a person out that dark window when it is not there.

### Transformations

The player piano was a brilliant invention. A long strip of paper is fed into a machine so that each line of it, corresponding to a moment in time, has holes in it at various places to denote what keys should be pressed to produce notes on the piano. It gets read through, and beautiful music gets played on it, and that 1800s bar that has it playing in the corner has happy patrons and the owner doesn't need to pay someone to play it. 

He does however have to pay the person to sell him some new music sheets to feed into it (patrons get bored so easily of the same old tune). The maker of the player piano is also making the sheets to feed into the piano. The maker isn't really a composer, but he pays for the rights to the music to be put on the sheet. It really cuts into his profits though, and the maker really would prefer not to have to pay the original musician. 

He is an inventive dude though and he makes another machine. It can take in 3 sheets of music he already already had made, and through some mechanical trickery it will blend then together with some randomness to create something that is a new song that is a chunked together Frankenstein's monster of the pieces of the original songs. 

His mind didn't form any of this music, the mechanical process just kaleidoscoped the original works into what he had.

According to current copyright law, distribution of this new piece would not be transformative, and would not grant him rights over the new piece and also would likely put him in hot water for violating the copyright of the 3 original pieces.

### Sweaty soupy brow

Any Warhol made a painting of Campbell's soup cans and fairly photo perfect. They were all lined up on rows of the painting, and in a different context, they would be violating copyright. But it was a transformative piece that was born from his imagination that was giving us a message.  I'm not sure what it was, but I think it was something about consumerism or branding or something.

He stitched together something from someone's work and made it his own. Not through mechanical processes, but from imagination and personal meaning, and made something that was defensible as "transformative" - a legal word that is part of copyright laws. It wasn't made just from the "sweat of his brow" to duplicate another's efforts, but from his creative desire go reframe it to mean something very different of what the original creator was intending.

Maybe this riding on the edge of what we do and don't allow is what drove him here.

### Back to the <s>meat</s> art grinder

Sam Altman's AI is more like the what the hypothetical player piano guy made. Feed in several billion works of writing or art, give it a description of what you want, and turn the crank on the side of the grinder and it will pick out bits of other people's works in a coherent enough way that you will feel satisfied that it matched your original prompt, and through the primitive parts of your brain, thanks to the ghosts of all the creative humans who unwillingly provided the inputs to this machine, you will feel that tingle that you might be communicating with a sentient being, when in fact you are speaking to something no smarter than a toaster.

That illusion is what the AI manufactures want us to buy in on, and fear of Sci fi terminators killing us all sells the illusion. If the AI was a semi-sentient being that they created, maybe that might lead to interesting thoughts about whether there was something being creative here, but there is really no thought, just probabilistic regurgitation. There is nothing "transformative" in the legal copyright sense of the word (which, as often is the case, is not the same as the non-legal oriented lay definition). There is no meaningful guiding hand here, and if you give just the right prompts to the machine, you will get something nearly identical to the original piece that was copied (though they are doing some work to prevent this so we don't see the machine behind the curtain). 

Hopefully the courts will see this and slam them to the mat legally for what they have done. I fear however that the magic man has already tricked us so far that we will never get that rabbit back in the hat.



## Landships
@date=2024-03-04
@tags=war

In WWI when tanks were being developed, they were first thought of landships. Kinda like a battleship that rolled on the land.

The Brits chose the rather commonplace name of tank to keep it a secret about what they were developing. "Oh, this here we are making... oh it's just a tank. Nothing interesting, move along now". Eventually the fake name became the real name through common use.

I sometimes wish the name Landship stuck.

Looking at the bohemiths of WWI, they kinda would look like a ship flowing over the mud with port and starboard guns aiming out the sides. Here is a picture of one show using a banana for scale:

## Why we shouldn't have switched to metric (clickbait!)
@date=2024-02-20
@tags=math

Ancient civilizations primarily used the base 12 number system. It was perfect because it has factors of 2,3,4,6, and you can even combine together like 8 being 2/3rds of 12. This was the base of mathematics for a long time, and gave rise to concepts such as angles, measurements of time, and was heavily used in tradecrafts that had to rely heavily on division: cooking, woodworking, etc. 

This lasted basically until the arabic number system which was base 10 was taken on by the romans who then spread it over the world, but the trades people created measurements that bridged the gap between the two, so you have names for groups of measurements that work off of the base 12 system.

Now we have further entrenched in base 10, and thanks to technology, we can use digital measurement devices to kinda get by, but it sucks when you decide to just work with a ruler and calculations in your head, because you end up with some long decimals, and even some infinitely repeating ones. Hell even computers have a hell of a time with it because it doesn't match up with their base 2 number system leading to strange behaviors where numbers that should be equal are not. 

The fun thing is, if we were using base 12, we wouldn't need metric. All of the imperial measurement names were just a bridge between two bases, and like metric, we might have special names for various scales, but really it would all just be moving the duodecimal point to the left and right. 

We should have went back to base 12 as that was the best, but I am sure that would have been even harder for the world to have embraced.

## Artificial Intelligence vs Computational Intelligence
@date=2024-01-24
@tags=ai, youtube

Youtube video for this: https://youtu.be/wb9hVUk3SS8

These two terms are sometimes used interchangeably, and there are many conflicting definitions that sometimes switch the roles of these terms. 

To me, artificial intelligence is the effort to simulate the real intelligence of humans. For this Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and other simulations of how human thought works would match. Modern LLMs would tend to fall in this bucket, even if their model isn't complete - it is at least inspired from and derived from how neurons work, with some shortcomings.

Computational intelligence would be along the lines Deep Blue, the first chess system to beat the the human chess world champion. It was programmed with an advanced database of openings, and a deep search algorithm that used heuristics to prune the search tree to find optimal solutions. This was a mechanical process that was written in concrete terms by man, and was special purposed. 

And Deep Blue, was basically one of the most CI systems of the time, but the time was dominated by these systems.

Now with AIs and their ANNs, we are having systems that build themselves from training data in databases of weighted neurons. These are not debuggable, and it is difficult to glean information about their inner workings, but the same could be said for their biological counterparts.

We are still lightyears from an AI that could be considered to have true general intelligence, similar to humans. I think we will have an another [AI Winter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter) to go through before we reach that point. 

AI is often oversold in some ways (I am a mixed AI cynic and optimist), but where it excels is what I would refer to as "pattern finding". That is really what is happening in LLMs - it finds the pattern in human writing to predict the next word, or for coming up with image patterns to add in image generation. 

It has been shown at being very good at identify cancers in MRIs, possibly better than people, thanks to having a huge body of training data.

Pattern matching has always been a power that computational intelligence has progressed on, but the new LLMs are ideal at the pattern finding aspect of things.

Just like identifying cancers with proper training in images, identifying records of interest with training from past data could be powerful.

## 3 exercises a day
@date=2024-01-11
@tags=exercise

So I have been doing two workout days for a while, and each one takes nearly an hour, and it becomes hard to get myself to be motivated to do it, it isn't a daily routine, and trying to fit in that big of a time block can be challenging during the day.

I thought about it a bunch, as this is the new year, and it seems to be a good time to have new plans, and considered cutting out a lot of exercises to the standard 5x5 stronglifts routine, but after reading more on advanced routines, I still wanted to cover a number of accessory lifts. 

With 14 total exercises, I decided to split it down into 5 days (squats are on 2 days) so that I have just 3 exercises to do each day, which are often able to be done in less than 20 minutes. 

The core full major lifts that are in 5x5 I do on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, and accessories are on Tues/Thurs. 

I have it so there is a week A and week B for alternating the repeating of some workouts. 

Monday
Bench Press / Overhead Press (Week A/B)
Curls
Squats

Tuesday
Pullup
Dips
Hip Thrust

Wednesday
Overhead Press / Bench Press
Dead Lift
Cable Row

Thursday
Lat Pulldown
Tricep Pull
Cable Fly

Friday
Dumbbell Bench / Arnold Press
Barbell Row
Squats (again)

The pattern for this is slightly derived from Graysckulls LP for the MWF. On Tuesdays I make it about bands for pullups and dips, and on Thursdays it is all about cables because both of those things are a pain to setup, so I make the days all about one of them, so it isn't so much about muscle groups as it is about laziness and speed. 

With all things now I try to get to 20 reps in a single exercise.

- If I make it, I up the weight the next time by 2.5 lbs.
- If I don't make it, I rest for 20 seconds, squeeze out more reps, and keep doing it until I get to the 20. I write down the number of reps, and keep the weight the same for the next workout. 

This all lends to the speed of the routine. You grind your way to 20, preferably in one set, and then you move on to the next exercise. Eventually you get to 20 in one set and keep progressing. 

As someone who got lots of minor injuries lifting heavy (muscle pulls that take me out for weeks), this method has led to continual safe weight progression without every stopping for weightlifting injuries - very much a slow and steady wins the race sort of thing.

Also, the speed and brevity of it all, makes it so it is easy to have part of my daily routine, which is better than being inconsistant.

I want to add more exercises to it: 
- Neck related lifts recommended by the graysckulls author
- KB swings as they seem to produce great results
- Farmers carry
- Jumprope
- Sprinting

But I am trying to keep myself in check and not fill the schedule and make it harder to commit to. Instead, I am going to make it so I have earn my upgrades, video game style, and figure I can add one ever time I complete 4 weeks of completing all exercises.

## Perfect quote about the hard part about programming
@date=2023-12-11
@tags=programming

"This is what I constantly tell my students: The _hard_ part about doing a tech product for the most part isn't the what beginners _think_ makes tech hard — the hard part is wrangling systemic complexity in a good, sustainable and reliable way.

Many non-tech people e.g. look at programmers and think the hard part is knowing what this garble of weird text means. But this is the easy part. And if you are a person who would think it is hard, you probably don't know about all the demons out there that will come to haunt you if you don't build a foundation that helps you actively keeping them away."

![[Pasted image 20231208132932.png]]

So I built Elf Factory initially when I didn't have a playdate, and created some tiny fonts to make it so a decent amount of text could appear on the screen.

That looked great on my computer monitor, but apparently not so much on the playdate.

Now that I have one in hand, I was able to tweak all the fonts to make them readable, and to some editing to make it so all the needed text appears on the screen, and it looks pretty great. I also updated the menu card for the game to look a little better and more festive.

The game is a speed puzzle game where you have to assemble presents from parts that are stacked on top of each other so that you can save Christmas:

## Tapping out a muscle group with 20 reps
@date=2023-11-16
@tags=exercise

I started doing a slight tweak to my workout routine. 

I do 1 set per exercise, and push to do 20 reps of that set. If I don't make it, I rest for 30 seconds and try to squeeze out some more, and repeat until I hit 20 with minimal rest.  
  
I write down the weight and the number of reps of my first failure. When I can make it to 20 reps without failure, then the next workout I up the weight. It works really well, and I can do a full body workout in under 45 minutes and get great gains thanks to really tapping out each muscle group.  
  
Doing heaver weights and less reps tends to cause more injuries for me (I am 46) and I always found I had plenty of gas still in the tank when I did drop sets, so I knew I wasn't really reaching my limit. This makes it so I can reach my limit without having to pull off plates and do lots of sets. It also gives an clear goal - 20 reps every time, even if you have to take mini breaks.

Research has shown that number of reps is not really that important to muscle growth - what is important is pushing to failure, and this seems to really get me to that failure. If I can't even do another rep at what should be a fraction of my 1 rep max, then I know that I have reached true failure. 

### Update 2024-05-31
Well, I started hitting walls with 20 reps for arms. It just is hard to get to 20 at the limits of what my arms can do, but using rep/weight calculations of the higher amount for 15 reps, I am able to achieve and upgrade my weights, even when I have been stuck for weeks at the limits of what I can do at 20. 

This only seems to apply to arms though. Legs and back seem to adapt just fine to upping weight at 20 reps, and haven't had problems there. My theory is that large muscles have a higher ability for long term stress. The little biceps and triceps just can't keep going.

I needed to drop out a background and turn it transparent, and I found this great site which allows you to do that and so much more with images:

You can create animated gifs, do art style filters, do some basic drawing and modifications, etc.

Many of the thinks you might open Photoshop or Krita for, but for simpler one offs. 


## Pointing away from the pointless

@tags=agile


This is a response to this article
https://medium.com/@kobalazs/five-fallacies-of-estimations-in-software-development-897c5bc0630f

I disagree with the whole team doing pointing thing. It always devolves into a much taller normal curve centered at 3 or 5 points. And it takes forever to come up with those useless scores.

My team has the senior frontend dev (me) and the senior backend dev doing all the grooming with POs. We ask the hard questions, flesh out the functional details of the story and assign the points. Our points end up being a reasonable spread between 1 and 8 points (13+ ends up with splitting - though our organization like many seem to be alergic to big numbers. I think 13s should be more common for a good spread, and 21 should be a splitter). 

This also helps with not having a bunch of engineers staring at a half baked jira story on zoom that then needs to be elaborated and pointed, wasting a huge number of man hours. At the scrum kickoff we review the already worked over stories, and engineers ask further refining questions before taking them on.

Team pointing is the biggest navel gazing waste of time. Find the most knowledgeable and pessimistic people on your team and pick two of them to do all the stories with the POs and call it a day.

A good measure of the quality of your teams pointing is to measure the standard deviation. A small SD would imply that your team sucks at pointing or somehow your POs are giving all semi equal sized tasks. In either case pointing is pointless for you.

A fun way to do planning poker is to give players a limited number of each type of card they could use so that there is a set number of 1s 2s 3s 5s... and then they have to ration out the numbers they can use.

Or maybe show the teams running SD and have a goal for a higher SD for each grooming session.

## Why isn't VR exploding into the mainstream?

You have two real options:  
1) PC VR with a huge upfront expense, a required dedicated space, and a wire attached to your head  
2) Quest - A tightly controlled platform with limited experimental titles. It is a pain in the ass to develop for, and if you don't make a smash hit, you won't be accepted on the storefront. Oh, and lower spec device, but I think people focus too much on graphics quality  
  
Yeah, you can bridge the gap between the two, but is kinda jenky.  
  
Whenever valve gets off their butt and releases Deckard, I think it will be a huge change. Develop easily on your PC, pay $100 to get on steam, and regardless of how indie you are, you can reach your audience.


## Meeting with people who have to come back to the office
@date=2023-08-23
@publishDate=2025-07-05
@tags=business

![[2023-08-23 back to work.png]]

So my company is telling all people within a 50 mile radius of work that they have to now come in 2 days a week. 

Currently seeing how it is effecting people who now has to spend an hour each day either way and the disappointment they have. 

The manager is talking about how it is applying to them, how they aren't getting an exception, and people will have to get in line to get an exception.

People are talking about how it makes no sense since everyone does zoom, and one was saying how they are thinking of moving out of the area to be beyond the 50 mile radius.

The trouble that I see is that people took the job or continued to work the job ignoring other opportunities because it was remote. Now they are going to incur a cost of travel time and wear and tear on their car, as well as the loss of being home with their families. 

There is no increased compensation for this, so in essence everyone is getting a pay cut. 

I expect that retention of some employees might be difficult if they are hit by this, and maybe those loses are worth it for the value of greater office collaboration.


Something that might help with retention is to offer a bonus after 6 months to everyone that goes with this plan and comes in the office for 80% of the Tuesdays and Thursdays during that time period. It would keep people on board while they normalize going to office work again without just losing good people who are most capable of jumping ship. It also wouldn't be an ongoing cost to the business, and be seen as an expense to make this transition and not have to deal with the cost of rehiring. It could even be a layered bonus for those who decide to move closer. 


Another perk that might be useful is actual offices with closing doors rather than cubicles and open office/bullpen seating. I have been in this field for long enough that I remember when that was the norm, and the change in office layouts, and losing the ability to have focused time in an office without distractions was part of the reason I switched to only remote positions roughly 10 years ago. A lot of engineers feel the same way (the correlation between software engineers and ADHD is pretty strong). It might be a good thing to advertise in job descriptions as well.

## 45 going on 46
@date=2023-08-21
@tags=thoughts

![[2023-08-21 dumbell.png]]

So I am 45, about to be 46. My father is 83. He is pretty far along with dementia, is in a VA home in Alabama, and nearly died, but that was due to being in a really bad state care facility prior that seemed to prefer to drug and leave their patients in a room to die rather than take care of the difficult ones. He recovered well, and is physically doing good, which ain't bad for having been on life support. He has been physically active his whole life, is strong, and I think that is part of the reason for his recovery.

So rounding back time to maybe about 75 for dad, and matching him to me, I have 30 good years left to do things before that downward slope to mortality. I have been aiming to be more physically fit: lift weights 2-3 times a week, run 2 times a week, and walk 4000 steps a day, and it shows. And aside from being more fit now, these are the things that correlate with a bonus of about +5 years of life, and probably a much slower downhill fall into old age weakness. 

My father-in-law (well x-father-in-law) who had a serious sky diving crash and who didn't look like he was ever going to walk again, now is starting to walk with a walker, and I attribute that to the fact that he is fit and always lifting. 

Strength training isn't so much for ascetics for me (I got all I need from my good looks with my beautiful wife) but sticking around and being someone my kids can look up to and their kids as well. I also keep myself interested in my millions of distractions and keep my brain as sharp as I can. 


## Movie review: the stand in
@date=2023-08-21
@tags=movie-reviews

![[2023-08-21 the stand in.png]]

In this movie, Drew Barrymore plays as both a slapstick comedy movie actor (Candy) that is famous, as well as her stand in (Paula). 

In it Candy hates her career as a character that basically is a mix of Johnny Knoxville and Adam Sandler. The Paula is the person who is there to stand in for her and take the abuse. 

Candy is a big drug/alcohol user, who blows up on set and for 5 years is out of business and just being a drunk in her mansion. Meanwhile she is having an online relationship with someone who is really into old style woodworking, and is really imagining living that lifestyle with him - a man she has has never met, neither knows what the other looks like, and has been talking to for over a year. 

Being dependent on Candy, Paula ends up losing everything and living in her car.

The setup comes where due to claiming she failed to pay her taxes because of the alcoholism, she is court ordered to do rehab, and she gets the Paula to take her place there, and then the Paula starts to take over the rest of her life, including her online boyfriend. 

It all gives the feeling of someone who doesn't appreciate what they have, just to have someone who appreciates it too much (Paula gets pretty underhanded) take it all away.

The movie is enjoyable as a dark comedy - nothing you will get laughs out of, but kinda a more darker version of Identity Thief. IMDB gave it a 4.7 out of 10, but I think that is because the movie sells itself differently then it is. This is more of a painful dark comedy similar to Very Bad Things. I love how Drew plays the two characters so differently that you they really feel like they were played by two different people, and then how Paula starts to transform when she enters the spotlight. 

Drew's actress character reminded me a bit of Tom Green (who she was married to long ago) - someone who did oddball physical humor, but eventually dropped out of Hollywood to live a more rustic lifestyle - which is something that Candy dreams of. Drew has remained friends with Tom long after their breakup, and watching an interview with the two of them, I still see there is some good heartfelt love and caring. I feel that this movie is heavily inspired.

![[2023-08-21 Tom Green.png]]

This is a dark comedy that is full of lessons and suffering, I'd give this movie an 8 out of 10. 

## Writing it down
@date=2023-08-21
@tags=writing

Writing things down is a way of thinking. Not a way of recording what you wrote. One way to do this is to create a TIL - today I learned. 

Another way is to apply the...
### The Feynman Technique

The Feynman Technique is a method named after the physicist Richard Feynman, designed to help individuals learn and understand subjects deeply. It aligns well with the practice of writing about what you learn, and its principles can be summarized in the following steps:

1. **Choose a Concept**: Select a concept or topic you want to understand.
2. **Teach It to a Child**: Try to explain the concept as if you were teaching it to a child. Use simple language and avoid jargon.
3. **Identify Gaps and Go Back to the Source Material**: If you find areas where your explanation falters, go back to the source material to fill in the gaps.
4. **Simplify and Use Analogies**: Create analogies and use simple language to make the concept more relatable and easier to grasp.
5. **Review and Refine**: Continuously review and refine your explanation until you can articulate the concept in the simplest terms possible.


## Solid - useContext
@date=2023-08-21
@tags=solidjs

I created a context system in SolidJS for forms

```javascript
export const FormContext = createContext<Form>();

export interface Form {
  data: any;
  set: (data: any) => void;
  validationResult: Accessor<Joi.ValidationResult<any> | undefined>;
  touched: Accessor<TouchedData>;
  setFieldValue: (field: string, value: string) => void;
  inputChangeHandler: (name: string) => (e: Event) => void;
}
/* snip */
export default function FormContextProvider(props: FormContextProviderProps) {
	/* set all of the form variable to apply to the context */

	return (
	    <FormContext.Provider value={form}>
	      <form use:formDecorator>{children}</form>
	    </FormContext.Provider>
    )
```

And in an input under that, I do:
```javascript
const form = useContext(FormContext);
```
and the form value seems to be stuck at undefined. :(

## Tailwind
@date=2023-08-07
@tags=coding, css

Tailwind is a css framework that with some html code that looks like this:
![[Pasted image 20230807125724.png]]

You can style your site without css. 

Instead, you throw classes on dom elements and then tailwind will ladle some css on your element to get it to look the way you like. 

As someone who has done scss for a long time, I rather like giving things a class name, fitting them in the structure of the site, and writing the css for them. You can set some padding, width, rounded borders, etc, fairly easy in css, and not learn and integrate another thing.

And projects with less frameworks are great.

## Custom tags to get over divitius
@date=2023-08-03
@tags=html
(note: update at end as there some issues with method)

Very often html looks like a soup of divs in projects
```
<div class="item">
	<div class="name">Toothpaste</div>
	<div class="description">Used to clean teeth</div>
	<div class="price">$20</div>
	<div class="actions"><button>add to cart</div>
</div>
```

Instead this could look like

```
<item>
	<name>Toothpaste</name>
	<description>Used to clean teeth</description>
	<price>$20</price>
	<actions><button>add to cart</actions>
</item>
```

That looks so much better. These are custom element names, and can be used in html. Note that while custom element names \<should-have-hyphens\> according to the spec (so as to avoid conflicts with future html element names), modern browsers will handle them fine without the hyphens.

One thing you will realize once you start using them is that they are by default `display-inline`, which is a hassle as you typically want them to be display:block by default as you will be using them to replace divs. 

You can handle this by starting out your css for your site like this:

```css
body * {
    display: block;
  }

  /* Revert all of the inline elements back to inline */
  a,
  abbr,
  acronym,
  b,
  bdo,
  big,
  br,
  button,
  cite,
  code,
  dfn,
  em,
  i,
  img,
  input,
  kbd,
  label,
  map,
  object,
  output,
  q,
  samp,
  select,
  small,
  span,
  strong,
  sub,
  sup,
  textarea,
  time,
  tt,
  var {
    display: inline;
  }
```


### UPDATE

After looking further into this, it turns out to be a horrible idea. Many native dom elements have a lot more variety in display settings and to do it the way I am here would need lots of catching for edge cases. For more details:

[html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/rendering.html](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/rendering.html).

In the end, it is best to just selectively give elements you create the display: block styling as needed. Tedious, but less likely to cause issues. 

You could also do something where only elements under a classed element get styled by default. This is done in scss so that the code is shorter:

```scss
.auto-display-block-decendents * {
    display: block;
  }
.auto-display-block-decendents{
  /* Revert all of the inline elements back to inline */
  a,
  abbr,
  acronym,
  b,
  bdo,
  big,
  br,
  button,
  cite,
  code,
  dfn,
  em,
  i,
  img,
  input,
  kbd,
  label,
  map,
  object,
  output,
  q,
  samp,
  select,
  small,
  span,
  strong,
  sub,
  sup,
  textarea,
  time,
  tt,
  var {
    display: inline;
  }
}
```

This list isn't exhaustive, and if you use things like tables, you will need to do re-apply proper styling, but you could use derivatives of this to just apply to isolated components and tweak the exceptions for those cases. 

## Didn't get into Meta
@date=2023-08-02
@tags=jobs
@publishDate=2026-07-05

I have worked at the likes of Intel, Cisco, and several other large companies that aren't so well known. I work as a principal engineer, and after about 25 years of professional software development, as well as a natural aptitude for it from an early age, I can say without feeling like I am boasting that at this point in my career, I have mastered my craft. 

Interestingly, after 3 attempts, I have yet to get hired at Facebook (aka Meta). This is kinda funny, as Facebook Marketplace was for quite a long time an app that was handled by a company other than Facebook, and I was the lead engineer of it. I kinda despise FB, and aside from their oversized salaries, I can't see any strong reason to work there, but I guess it has become kinda my Moby Dick thing and I want to get the job just for the sake of proving to myself I can get it.

In either case, most recently I embarrassingly didn't make it past the first technical screening interview, even though I can say I knocked it out of the park. The interviewer escalated and tried every angle to stump me, and with ease I was able to solve every one of his progressively more difficult problems, and also I feel I had a good casual positive rapport with the interviewer. 

Yesterday, I found that I didn't get the job. 

Today, I looked at my analytics for my blog. Dear reader, if you are here, keep in mind that you are all alone, typically, as no one really reads this blog. I more write it for my own enrichment, and on a really good day, I might have 1-2 visitors stumble upon it. 

In the past two days, I had about 10 new users viewing it.

![[Pasted image 20230802104523.png]]

My guess is that they were FB hiring people, that were looking into my web presence to find out more about me. If you combine this blog, twitter, facebook, reddit, etc; you eventually will come to a picture of someone who's counter culture mindset would not align with facebook's core beliefs. 

This was the text of the rejection letter:

```
I wanted to thank you again for coming to interview with the Meta, and for your patience as we collected feedback.  

We were able to review feedback with the team, and unfortunately at this time we will not be moving forward in the process.   

Unfortunately, due to company policy I am not able to share feedback from the interview.  

It was really great working with you and I would really like to stay in touch. If it's OK, we'd like to keep your resume on hand as future opportunities present themselves and we continue to grow. After 12 months have passed, we can revisit this with you again.
```

So I'll never know if my personal beliefs ran counter to their culture, or if some other minor thing threw off my interview acceptance. I guess I'll just have to accept the mystery. On the plus side, for a moment I had more readers of my blog ;)

Perhaps I should get a new, better white whale than a job at a company that I despise. Something that has a little more personal meaning and won't be hollow upon achieving it. 

## Making millions
@date=2025-07-30
@tags=money, business
@publishDate=2025-07-05

When people say they make 6 figures, it means they make somewhere just over 100k. These are usually fairly high skilled labor. 

The average salary is about 50k.

With most retailers paying up to $15 for mostly unskilled labor, the lower end of yearly income is about 30k. 

If you go furtherest up the skill tree to laborers working the best payed jobs at companies such as google, you can get up to 200-250k. Basically the highest paid worker makes 8-10x what the lowest paid worker makes. 

That is pretty much it, and it is hard to get past that summit, even if you are a super star worker. No amount of elbow grease or skillset is going to bust you out of making more than that if you are working for someone else. That is the salary bell curve and it gets real thin on the right side. Yeah, there are some exceptions such as athletes, movie stars, and CEOs that break the bell curve and get paid way beyond that for basically being an in demand worker that isn't replaceable, but those people have climbed some serious mountains to get there.

And yet there 22 million millionaires in the USA alive today  [[source](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/retirement/how-many-millionaires-in-us)] out of a population of about 300 million Americans. That is stored up income though, and not annual income, so plenty of 6 figure incomes can get there. 0.5% earn over a million a year [[source](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/04/united-states-actual-perceived-income-gap-economy/)].

That is still a pretty big percentage. That is 1 out of every 200 in your high school graduating class. That is too big of a number to account for with high paid athletes and movie stars.

What that number does represent is business owners. People who run restaurants or business franchises, car dealerships, or small service companies online. People who employ other people to provide value to others, and then make money off of that value minus the overhead of the business and employees. The people who will pay people somewhere between the 30k-200k that everyone else makes. 

That is the realistic way to break out of the glass ceiling and climb to something beyond is not getting a paycheck from someone else. You have to serve more than your boss. You have to serve hundreds, thousands, or millions of people with something that you create and provide to them. The creation of the service you provide to them could be from your own two hands, or from the employment of others to fulfill that creation on a grander scale, but you are no longer getting a big paycheck from an individual or business, but you are getting tiny paychecks from a multitude of individuals or businesses. 

That is a challenging path to walk in self motivation, financial risk, and also endless mental and possible physical energy that comes with not riding on the back of someone else that provided you with those things (your employer). It is a grind to get further and further to the right of the salary bell curve, but eventually you will hit a limit where you will plateau, and that plateau will be based on your skill compared to everyone else in your profession, and the limits of your profession, but when you work for yourself serving others, that plateau is more amorphous, and it depends on your business sense and your ability to see opportunity. The scary thing is that plateau could be zero or even negative $ if you are crap at running a business, but if you get a few standard deviations above the average on that bell curve, you could be making 100's of times more income than you could ever make as an employee.

@tags=thinking-out-loud, solid-js, neverall, forums
@publishDate=2024-07-24

So, I am working on this forum software for neverall.com/f. I am working on making right now in solidjs because I feel that is a better platform for development.

I have the server all setup in node.js. This is now able to handle registration and login.

I have basically nothing as far as the front end code right now. I am debating using react vs solidjs.

The benifit of react, is I don't need to learn something new. I know react through and through. Also I can easily find and hire devs doing react coding.

The downsides of react is it is slower, more bloated, and can become more convoluted then solidjs to develop in. 

So really, do I build in react so I can get more cheap readily available devs, or do it in solidjs, take a little more effort upfront learning something new (that no one is hiring for - probably because they hit the same delima I am now hitting), have a cleaner codebase, and have a smaller pool of talent to hire from.

On the upside, there are people looking to work with solidjs, but can't find any jobs with it, and they also are likely highly skilled to be interested in it. Also, you can train javascript people to work with it, and it does create employment lock in as there isn't many places they can take their skills.

## Password validation done better
@date=2023-07-11
@tags=coding, security

One of the most annoying user experiences is registering and trying to create a password that passes a bunch of validation rules, such as must contain a uppercase, lowercase, special character, etc. 

This doesn't always create the strongest password, and more importantly it doesn't create the most memorable password. 

Passphrases are way more secure and memorable, but sadly they won't pass password validation rules unless you sprinkle some extra stuff to remember on them. 

XKCD does a good job demonstrating their strength:
![[xkcd-passphrases.png]]

Users should have the option of constructing a password however they like, as long as it is strong.

If you password was just lower case letters, then it's strength is 26^numberOfCharacters (because there are 26 letters in the alphabet, so if your password was 4 letters long, then there would be 26*26*26*26 possible combinations).

Throw in some upper case characters, and it is 52^numCharacters. 

Numbers as well 62^numCharacters

etc, etc.

The important thing is even if you just use lower case letters, the exponent is the most important thing, and that is the number of characters you type. 

So with all this in mind, here is a validator function that will measure your password strength and give you some suggestions on how to make it stronger if it is too weak. 

```javascript
Validator.register(

"strongPassword",
(value) => {
  value = String(value);
  const containsAnUppercaseLetter = /[A-Z]/.test(value);
  const containsALowercaseLetter = /[a-z]/.test(value);
  const containsANumber = /\d/.test(value);
  const containsASpecialCharacter = /[^a-zA-Z\d]/.test(value);
  const numberOfPossibleCharacters =(containsAnUppercaseLetter ? 26 : 0) + (containsALowercaseLetter ? 26 : 0) + (containsANumber ? 10 : 0) + (containsASpecialCharacter ? 32 : 0);
  const strength = numberOfPossibleCharacters ** value.length;
  return strength > 1e13;
},
"Your password is not strong enough. You can add more characters, numbers, and symbols to make it stronger."
);

## Firefox youtube downloader add on
@date=2023-07-07
@tags=hacks, youtube

It seems that any addon related to youtube downloading gets zapped form the Firefox and Chrome app stores. :( 

Here is one I have used on Firefox that disappeared:

<a href="shared/Youtube Video Downloader - {a7847979-429e-4a40-8651-1a50fd8382ce}.xpi">Youtube Video Downloader - {a7847979-429e-4a40-8651-1a50fd8382ce}.xpi</a>

If you want to audit it before installing it, change the extension to zip, and unzip it (xpi is just a zip file). It looks like it was created by someone french, but the code is pretty simple. 

## Making a laptop holder
@date=2023-07-03
@tags=3d-printing

I like to use my 3d printer a lot, but sometimes when there is a problem, I drop out of use for a while. Recently, a big ball of melted plastic formed around the hot end, and I didn't have an urge to fix it for a while.

Since we were doing the Nightmare Before Christmas as the theme for our cardboard boat for the Longview Cardboard Boat Regatta, Tara was making a Zero out of paper mache, and he needed a nice orange pumpkin nose, so the printer needed to be fixed up.

I heated it up to ABS temperature, and then took a sodering iron to cut off chunks of it, then pried off whatever was left. All worked great, and no that the pumpkin was done, it was time to do something else.

I hook up a laptop to my screen via usb-c and need a way to hold it vertically. I figured I should throw in some cable management, pen slots, and maybe some spaces to put magnets to put things like paperclips on. 

First I started in Tinkercad with a large rectiliniar cube as a hole to represent the laptop, and then put it 4 mm above the ground. Then I stacked the other parts around it and added cuts. This is the primary mode I do for design. Add chunks and then do subtracts. 

![[before-cuts.png]]

![[after cuts.png]]

I also try to work with multiples/fractions of 12. Base 12 has the most factors (12, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1) and works well for keeping things scaled in pleasing proportions to each other (this is why lego is base 12, the imperial system works off of base 12, our clocks, western music scales, and many other things). So the height for the surrounding bases are 6mm high, and everything follows from there. 

So off to the printer it goes, and here is the final product:

## Cardboard Boat Regatta
@date=2023-07-12
@tags=fun, projects

Longview has an annual cardboard boat regatta, and I wanted to participate this year. 

The theme was Christmas in July, and my daughter Chloe's favorite movie is Nightmare Before Christmas, so of course we had to do that. 

I had my neighbor Scott and my son Jevon help with the construction.

My wife Tara made the most awesome paper mache zero:

The boat ended up being over 16 feet long:
![[2023-07-02-cardboard-boat-long.jpg]]

And of course I had to surprise Chloe with being Jack the day of (this is actually ella in the picture).

Chloe and me before boat launch:
![[2023-07-02-cardboard-boat-with-chloe.jpg]]

The boat ended up being too long and unstable (we had 4 adults and 2 kids in it). Amazingly we made it through two of the races, but ended up being dead last in the second race as the boat had a turn radius of about a mile, and on the second race, started to turn into a squishy accordion in the front.

Thankfully we were able to save Zero.

## You have to check yourself
@date=2023-07-01
@tags=time-management, social-media

I have various timers. I use <a href="https://www.dejal.com/timeout/">Time Out</a> to remind me to take time away from my screen to walk around, play some violin, lift weights, or just grab a cup of coffee and take a minute to chat with my wife and have a moment with the kids. 

If I am deep in thought or work or even some distraction, I will skip my every 10 minute break, but it is a reminder to assess what I am currently doing, and whether it is how I wanna spend my time (side eye look at social media sites).

On my phone I cap my time there as well. Some wellness thing that comes with Samsung phones lets you set the max time you use an app, and I limit my Firefox use. It provides some ways of overrides, but they are happily annoying to use, and so I only use them when there is something I actively need.

I use reddit on firefox, which admittedly is the biggest use of it. I uninstalled the app, and their browser version is annoyingly not built to endlessly navigate nicely. They do this to compel you to use their app, but I like it as it keeps me from descending too deep down that scrolling rabbit hole. 

All this is to keep a mental awareness of where I am putting my focus so I can decide on it rather than just let impulse take control. The monkey brain is weak compared to the tsunami of distractions on the internet. 

And here you are reading my blog. Are you gaining something from it? Is it enriching you life experience? Are you learning something? It is ok, if you are just wasting your time, just as long as you are appreciating the wasting.

I think that is the thing for me. In moderation I enjoy delving into a pit of distraction, and come out feeling refreshed and perhaps a bit more knowledgable. But sometimes, a day gets washed away chasing the shiny lights in the distance, and I feel disappointed in myself and reflect on not even getting anything out of the experience.

I start my day with a task list of to do items, and admittedly I rarely check off all the boxes, but to look back on the previous day and see a bunch of empty squares and nothing of an enjoyable experience to reflect on encourages me to check myself. 



## Brought in my google plus backup
@date=2023-06-29
@tags=blogging, googleplus, ai

About 5 years ago google plus went by by, but I made sure to export using their checkout feature all the posts. 

Turns out that I was a pretty prolific poster there with about 250 posts. Each exported file was a way too cluttered blob of html and style code. 

I had the goal of copying them into this blog one by one by hand, but about 20 in I realized this was going to be impossible. 

I dumped them into a new vscode project, and with some heavy leaning on Git-Copilot for making complex regex expressions I was able to siphon off what was needed from each file, and reformat it for the most part into something that could be used in this markdown formatted blog. 

Copilot is great when you put in a comment about what you want to parse from a string, taking that and creating a regex for that.

If you are scrolling through, basically anything from 2018 back is from google plus. Later I am going to bring in my twitter and tumbler feeds as well as some of my stuff over on fb. It is time to bring all things back to old school with just a straight up anti-social networking blog.

Also with this, I will be bringing my youtube videos here, and not via embedding their widget on the site. It would be nice to just do it myself

## Doubled strength about 1 year since workout charting
@date=2023-06-27
@tags=exercise

![[strength spreadsheet 2022.png]]
![[strength 2023.png]]

So this marks about a year since I started charting my weightlifting journey, and for most of the exercises I have doubled my strength. 

In my older age, I have found that more reps and less weight is the way to avoid pulling muscles - a thing that in the past has hampered progress, keeping my away from the weights for weeks at a time. 

My goal has been to do 20 rep max for each workout, eeking forward 5-10 pounds each week. 

This page:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-repetition_maximum

has formulas that will convert any rep/weight combination to what you would lift as a 1 rep max, and the research shows the one by Wathen seems to be the best:

![[Wathen formula.png]]

Experimenting myself one day with bench press, I can attest that it solidly was able to calculate my 1 rep max. I can also attest that such weights are really enough strain that it makes it more concerning pushing yourself so hard, when the same gains can be had on the other side of the spectrum. 

If you would like to use these formulas in your own google spreadsheet, you can go to Data->Named Functions and add them:

### ONEREPMAX
Takes reps and weight and will output your one rep max.
```
=IF(AND(weight > 0, reps > 0), weight * 1/(0.488 + 0.538 * EXP(-0.075*reps)), "")
```

### XREPMAX
How much weight is expected for x reps. This is flipping around the equation to figure out weight you could lift at any rep range, given a one rep max value. 

You could do something like
```
=XREPMAX(ONEREPMAX(110, 10), 15)
```
with a weight of 110 and a reps of 10, and see what you could lift if you instead aimed for 15 reps.

Here is the function:
```
=CEILING (onerepmaxweight*(0.488 + 0.538 * EXP(-0.075*reps)))
```

If you the labels for the workouts like `Barbell Row 271,202,165`, that label shows my 1Rep, 10Rep, and 20Rep calculated maxes. 

All of this is just motivational though. The important is to step up the 20 rep max each day. And to really get the most out of the workout, when I don't hit 20 reps, then I force myself to lower the weight by 5 pounds at a time until I hit the 20 reps again. And 5 pounds at 20 reps, is like 8.25 pounds of 1 rep max (an added bonus is you need less plates as well)

## Tenacity
@date=2023-06-27
@tags=motivation

Do the imperfect.

Do that which is tedious in whatever way gets you through it.

Though it may suck, both the doing and how well you do it, it is far better than to not do the thing you are looking to do.

Everyone is always intimidated that the thing they want to do is populated by those who are producing such quality. Remember that everyone starts out at the bottom. (example: http://robkohr.com/articles/popular-youtubers---look-at-their-old-stuff)

But remember anything is better than zero, and being persistently bad is how you get to be good. 

To help, log, chart, keep records of how bad you are with whatever you are looking to achieve. What seems demotivating now will help remind you of how those minuscule daily improvements lead to greater things. 

## Created a new blog render
@date=2023-06-26
@tags=coding, blog, obsidian

I wiped out RobKohr.com as I haven't touched it in over 5 years, and replaced it with this blog. 

It was built just using one long markdown file called blog.md that I edit in obsidian and each article is separated by ## Blog titles, and under that I use @date and @tags to specify those two values. Keeping with a brutalist design aesthetic, I render out those tags as well as the ## at the beginning of the headers. 

The way it works is a build.js file that reads that file, splits it into separate articles, renders the md->html, applies some extra rendering and css, and spits them all out into a large collection of individual files. This makes for a very simple light weight site builder that is just serving static files. 

Source code is here for those who want to do something similar:
https://github.com/RobKohr/robkohr.com

If you need any help getting it set up, let me know.

## Stackoverflow instead of beating your head against the wall
@date=2023-06-22
@tags=stackoverflow, coding, programming

Often you will get deep in some code and come up against a wall. After working through it, and reading some documentation, if you haven't figured it out, it is time to go to stackoverflow.

I have been on stackoverflow for a little over 14 years now, and while I don't answer a lot of questions (there is a lot of competition for that) I have a lot of questions that I have asked and have given me a pretty respectable score, putting me in the top 6% of users (https://stackoverflow.com/users/101909/robkohr). 

The best things to do, is clearly state the problem, provide *concise* code that shows the problem in a reproducible way, and then state what you would like to achieve. 

Sometimes when I work hard at making a clear question on stack overflow, I end up figuring out the answer myself. This is kinda like rubber duck debugging, but instead of a rubber duck, you are talking to the internet.

Then you end up with being the person asking and answering the question and giving yourself double internet points... which is *oh so important* :) 


## Popular YouTubers - look at their old stuff
@date=2023-06-22
@tags=youtube, motivation

I kinda love going to a popular youtuber's channel, going to their videos section, and sorting by oldest. 

What is now a polished producer of content that makes you feel intimidated to even attempt to make videos was once someone with a crappy camera, shooting in their back yard with a bad audio setup. 

Everyone had to learn to walk before they could run. Whatever you do, that you are doing bad and are discouraged, know that failing is just the first step on the long road to greatness (or the medium length road to goodness if you don't want to overcommit yourself). 


It isn't that you lack an innate gift that others have, it is simply that you haven't put in the focused effort over time to achieve. Just keep on grinding and leveling up, because remember, everyone sucked at first. 

## Learned how to spell Labyrinth
@date=2023-06-22
@tags=life-goals, rpg

Just remember it starts with Laby. 

Just a word I gave up on trying to spell right long ago. I have never been a good speller, and I think I have a slight bit of dyslexia, so I never really saw the inner spelling of the word, but finally I just decided to split the word into pieces, and remember how the first part goes, and now it is easy :)

Anyway, I found this Labyrinth RPG game that is great for kids here:

https://www.amazon.com/dp/1916011551?psc=1&smid=A10N5GI8B3O43K&ref_=chk_typ_imgToDp

and I am going to watch the movie of it with them, and then surprise them with the game.

Reading through the game, it sounds like it would make a great video game/VR experience.


## Every day I am shuffling
@date=2023-06-20
@tags=side-projects, focus, motivation

Consistency is what I have been progressing more to. It helps to have lots of ideas and passion, but to do something big: build strength, learning a music instrument, run for office, build a side project, etc, requires doing something every day towards that goal in an endless way. I am actually doing all of those things right now, while raising kids and working full time.

To achieve it all - each thing needs 20-60 minutes per day to care and feed a goal to reach maturity.

I don't beat myself up though. I just have a daily checklist in a markdown textfile, and I can see how many I do each day and try to do them all. I frequently fail, but I try to get done what I can. 

## Reddits fall - maybe turn Neverall into a Reddit clone?
@date=2023-06-16
@tags=reddit, neverall, social-media

Finish up the analytics part, and then create a reddit clone on Neverall. The url could be something like neverall.com/n and then the subreddit name. I could have neverall.com/g be for games, and neverall.com/s for sites, and neverall.com/p for projects, and neverall.com/b for blogs, and neverall.com/d for docs, and neverall.com/qa for a stackoverflow like forum.

## How you move a mountain, one stone at a time
@date=2023-06-16
@tags=workout, exercise, fitness, motivation

I have been working out using a google spreadsheet to track workouts. I aim to do a 20 rep max each week for each exercise that is slightly above the previous week. So far, it has lead to a nice continuous improvement... assuming I don't ever skip weeks. Each time I skip more than 2 weeks it pushes me back a little bit. More when I skip a month.

Using Wathen's formula from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-repetition_maximum for 1RM, I can calculate my 1RM from my 20RM, and I also use it to calculate my 10 rep max. After experimenting with it, I found it to be a really accurate formula as I tested it going down to 3 reps. 

What this means for me is I can keep doing 20 reps as my target, and it will always keep my 1RM and 10RM improving. This is great as being someone in their mid-40s the strain on my body when doing lower rep maxes is not worth it as I frequently end up hurting myself with lower reps. 

Based on the equation, an increase of just 1 pound in weight is equal to 1.64 pounds in 1RM. This means that I am increasing my 1 rep max faster by doing 20 reps than I would be if I was aiming on doing 1 rep.

Jevon and I walked up 23rd ave and down 24th. It was great doing it with him as we could each hit one side of the street. We weren't knocking on doors, just putting card stock fliers under door mats. 

It was a good day to do it, and he brought his bike so it was easy to get around. Eventually we started to run out of cards and didn't complete the loop, but we will continue tomorrow. 

Later today I will be working on the boat with Scott.

For WFS I am working on the services page and the services need to be sortable in the settings, and then show the forms in the sorted order when making a new service request. Right now the order is hard coded, and each component has its own property set. I am going to create a wrapper for the components that will take all of the properties they need, and then pass them down to the component. The display order for the services can then load all of them in.

## Some apps and games that I would really like to finish
@date=2023-07-24
@tags=coding, games, apps, playdate, love2d, godot, nodejs
@publishDate=2028-07-24

Host this blog - could be a simple script that creates the html for the page.

ConstantSail - the pirate and sailing game. It was the first thing I made with node.js and I would like to recreate it using love2d

Feedback site - a site where people can post ideas and vote on them. This could be used as a white-label service for other people to use, and I could start it as a free service, and it could collect some SEO weight. More importantly I can use it to collect feedback on my other projects. 

Godot Asset Store - This one is getting the most traffic according to Google Analytics. I need to get it up and running and start selling some assets.

Convert Elf Factory and Jewel Defender to love2d. They can then be on mobile and steam instead of just being on the Playdate. 

I have some feeling that I should do things in godot, such as for VR games, but there is a reason I was able to get games out for playdate - it was really easy to build for, and I could get a game done in a week, rather then several months.

And I also learned that bandsaws make great paper cutters.

I also learned I don't like using layout tools such as Power Point or MacOS Pages, and love to just make everything in html/css and take a screenshot of it for printing purposes (I had to resize just right to get 4 cards per page). 

I can type everything out, put them in divs positioned however, and adjust fonts, images and everything with a few keystrokes. Guess I might be a web nerd. 


## Back to solidjs
@date=2023-06-12
@tags=coding, svelte, solidjs
@publishDate=2025-01-01

I delved into svelte pretty deep to get a grasp of it. I decided to try to make a set of components similar to material UI, just focusing on form elements. 

When it came to passing values, references, functions up and down the component stack, it just became much more difficult than doing it in React, which makes things pretty trivial.

I got hit with the feeling that I was just playing with magic that I didn't understand. 

This past week I built two static sites for running my school board campaign using solidjs. It has some basic routing and property passing, so I haven't really given it a good trial yet, but so far it seems to be an easy stand in for React. I'll need to give it eventually the same sort of test I did with Svelte.

I have a desire to move to SolidJs to move away from some of the re-rendering inefficiencies and difficulties in passing values around in React. 

## My daily process with Obsidian

- I use it to write this blog here. 

I think about making a blogging app, but I like what I do. I have one long markdown file with articles separated by headers and with some date and tags added to it. 

I need to create something for my blogging better.

## Telemarketing speed bump
@tags=telemarketing-speed-bump
@date=2023-03-01

Start a timer and see if you can beat your all time score. Just listen and talk to them. Remember, every 10 seconds you are on the phone, they are losing out on harassing someone else - you are really helping a lot of people and costing them money, thus destroying a bit of their scammy business. I call it being a telemarketing speedbump.

Find out everything about their product, but be hesitant and hard to sell to, but eventually relent. The best are vacation or auto warranty scams because there are an infinite amount of questions you can ask and ask again.

You will move up their call center to their top guys that close the deal. Then when you are need to give them your cc or ssn number, make something up. For the cc, use the first 8 digits of a real cc as those verify that it is real and associated with a provider. I then write out the last made up digits so I can repeat them. Each time you read the card number, read it fast, and switch around the digits and mumble.

Eventually they will figure out that you have been fucking with them, and oh boy the series of curses that will flow out of them. Eventually they will put you on a do not talk to list. They will call you, some times go “oh”, or maybe be pissy and hang up.

I think the service that calls you is different then who you eventually talk to. They hire the robodialer company, and sometimes they hire another agency to do the initial screening. Then they have the low level person that gets all of your info, and if they think they got a deal (a sucker) in hand, then they move you up to the real closer.

It is fun, and I have some made up names I rotate through and how many kids and all kinds of stuff. I am never rude - maybe a bit playful. I am not mad at the low pay workers that are grinding at this.

It is really their entire business that I hate. Almost all of them are built to fleece gullible people out of their money. Travel deals, auto warranties, student loan debts, computer virus fakers, amazon false charges, etc are not real businesses. Some really try to get into your phone and computer to rob your bank accounts. Student loan debt companies try to get into your federal student loan system and become your debt collector, but never paying off your loan.

They are EVIL, and the only way we take them down is by patiently talking to them… forever! If just 1% of people did this and acted like convincing targets, and kept them on for 10 minutes at a time, their business models would crumble. If you are reading this, you are now part of that 1% army that needs to be happily agreeable (but sometimes act skeptical to reel them in) to save the other 99% of mankind from this plague that has beset us. Take up your phone and take up the fight. If you record the call, post it up to tictok, youtube, or whatever with the hashtag `#telemarketingspeedbump`

I still do think that AWS is like sticky fly paper to tech organizations. Yes, come use all of our fancy small services... oh, yes, you liked that, but now good luck every leaving. 

And it works great on nerds like me who like to fiddle with something quickly, then start building a project with this new tool, and then it becomes part of a larger thing.

If you just get commodity VPS or dedicated servers, and spread them across different data centers and providers, you can achieve the same uptime, and with some open source packages you can achieve most of what those aws services provide for a fraction of the cost.

Being a fan of time travel movies, and my wife being a fan of romantic time-travel movies, this was an easy choice. This is a story of a girl who lost the love her life in a tragic accident, and getting a chance to go back in time to save him with at time traveling mix tape. The catch is that she can only go back to individual moments captured by the songs in the mix tape and only for the length of that song. 

The love this couple felt for each other really got me in the heartstrings. If you have ever been truly head over heels for someone that you would be willing to throw your whole life away for them and even die just to be with them a little longer (or at least dream of that love) then this movie will be instantly relatable to you. This is not a cutesy Meg Ryan kinda romance. This one hits hard, and is amazing.

The time travel mechanic slice of the movie is also amazing as well. It is great with how limited it is, and the main character, with how deeply she is damaged with his death, and how much she wants to save him is reckless and not carefully logical with how she uses it, which helps create some pain for the audience, but in a good way, and the resolution of the what she chooses shows how she grows as a character and leads to one of the most satisfying endings I have seen in a movie in a long time.

This movie really has you connect deeply to her struggle, from the death that you can never get over, even when others are moving on, to the pain of having what you have be so close, but you can never quite fix things. 

The lead character was deep, flawed, interesting, and so well formed that I could get a good feel on who she really was as a person. The boyfriend and sister also did a fine job, and it was a pleasant surprise to see Danny Glover pop up in this movie, and while old, definitely not too old for this shit. He plays a record shop owner, and general wise old man who dishes out some advice - advice that I found as questionable as the lead character found, but gosh did he do it in a charming way. 

Anyway, go see this darn movie. It is currently streaming on Hulu.

## On game development
@date=2022-12-05
@tags=gamedev

My mind gets such a buzz from taking an idea and spinning it into the concept for a game and then making it so (the last part being so ardurious that it rarely comes into being). This fun open ended thought process that then needs to be rangled by the realities of time and effort to actually make it real, and if you don't wrangle it well enough, and commit hard enough, it just gets stacked on the bin of ideas that never see the light of day (which is surprising considering that that hill is taller than any mountain in the known universe).

I love the work that I do, but hell if I wouldn't love to be just making my income making games instead... but for myself, not working at a game company. That sounds about as much fun as loving donuts and getting hired at a donut factory. 


## Inserting political messaging into education
@date=2022-08-22
@tags=politics

![[10 Other books to ban immediately.png]]

The actual samples of things the press actually show from the rejection list are things like math textbooks using "What me, racist?" and then having the student use racial bias data that is questionable to solve a problem. This is subtly pushing the racial focused narrative, and they are finding it in a huge number of textbooks, which clearly is a way of pushing a message into kids with a million little cuts.

The message may be right or wrong depending on your opinion, but even if right, it is wrong to try to indoctrinate a belief by sprinkling it throughout all coursework. That is propaganda and with the subtleness that they are doing it, brainwashing.

Also, note that the American Federation of Teachers president that shared a list of banned books retracted it, because the books were not actually banned and the information was fake.

This is much more nuanced, and there is a real problem that is being addressed. If conservatives were controlling education and trying to insert their message everywhere in subtle ways to little kids, wouldn't you feel pretty pissed off? It is tempting to indoctrinate the mass of future adults with your beliefs through little levers as they are a captive audience in the education system, but that is not a situation that should be abused for even righteous goals. Let them form their own opinions and just teach them the subject they are being taught.

## On Nostalgia In The Evolution of Music
@date=2022-02-14
@tags=music,philosophy

I looked up 2000's music yesterday on spotify. I am a child of the 80's and 90's and when I listen to music, I really lean heavy into those decades, and like most people when they hit middle age, they tune into the newest music on the radio, and feel that the music of their childhood is way superior.

We are now in the 2020's, and so the '00's music would be basically retro today, as depressing as that sounds. Also, admittedly, I don't know any of the music except for a few hits from the 2000's, so I was surprised to be enjoying the mix, where I was hating the current top 40's.

Then I was hit with a realization... and probably a pretty obvious realization. 

This realization stemmed also from listening to top 40 countdowns by year from the 80's and 90's... 

Whatever the time period, most music kinda sucks. Those songs from your childhood - they were the cream of the crop; the ultra-fit songs that survived the brutal process of musical natural selection. There are plenty of them, but they only account for 5% of the stuff that was playing on the radio all the time. This is why you remember them. It was exciting when something really good came on the radio. 

This is why the 2000's top hits mix is so much better than what is in the top 40 today, and even without the rose colored lenses of nostalgia. They are the ones that people made sure to include in the mix, and it is chosen from a full 10 years of music. Radio stations that are playing the newest hits, aren't playing things from 4 years ago, because it has become dated and it isn't hip, but when that music graduates on to a decades channel when those that are young and hip now become adults, they will continue the trend of thinking their music was the best.

Yeah, nostalgia makes the decades you grew up in warm and fuzzy. But go back and listen to music of the 60's and 70's, eras you didn't grow up in, and that music is also fantastic, even if less familiar. It is simply that choosing the top 40 of a decade 10 years after that decade ends will result in a much better collection of music than if you are just choosing whatever is in vogue today.

This can be extended to movies, clothing fashions, cars, catch phrases, and anything. The stuff that was good enough to stick in your brain 10 years later has battled it out with whatever was cool at any time, and yeah it might have been played out at the time, you can be damn sure you are singing along and talking a yarn about how great it was today to your kids who just look at you as some senile old parent who just doesn't get it.

And thus the cycle goes on.

## John Cleese On Creativity Summary

@date=2021-08-27
@tags=self-improvement

Original video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5oIIPO62g

(There are also some other videos of him talking about creativity)

Creativity is derived from play.

We exist in one of two states: Open and Closed

Closed is for when creativity is decided on and should be the follow up to being open. Don't try to be creative when closed, focus on implementing - kinda like if you are doing a motorcycle jump, you don't want to be thinking of how to change it up when you are in the processes of making the jump.

The open system is where creativity flourishes.

It needs the following:

### Space

A place carved out without any tasks to do.

When you are in this space, you will start out trying to think of all the things in life that you need to do. It will take some time to get over them, but don't engage with them. Don't try to complete any tasks in open mode.

### Time

A set of time with a specific endpoint. This part is important. It isn't playtime without an endpoint to play. You need to have more than 30min to get life tasks out of the way though, so don't choose too short of a time. Also, it can be exausting to go for too long. Having 1.5 hrs should be the cap.

### Time (yes again)

When you come up with an idea, don't just grab it and go with it. John talked about a fellow script writer that did this and that persons scripts were as fully realized.

Let the idea set and keep playing with it.

Also keep in mind there is nothing right or wrong. Throw out complete drivel. Good ideas are often the joining of two concepts that lead to something greater. But there are an infinite amount of bad combinations. Feel free to explore whatever, as sometimes bad combinations lead to great ones.

### Confidence

There is nothing wrong and there is no mistakes. Let Humor rule as that can lead to great things. You can still be funny with something serious. Avoid being solumn. There is always room for levity in coming up with solutions.

When exploring ideas, just keep thoughts gently around the subject matter, but don't worry about being to tight. As long as it lightly is grazing the goal, it will settle back into what you are looking for.

Always be positive and avoid saying no... kinda like sketch comedy, you always want to give a path for more and not shut things down.

Phrases like:

- Go on
- can you explain that better

He finishes off talking about how the japanese have meetings with no plan, and importantly let the junior people talk first. This way, they don't have to be in a position where they would have to disagree with their 
superiors.



## Balancing and doing side projects

@date=2021-08-15

Consistency with side projects is only accomplished with scheduling tasks on a consistent basis.

## Pivotal tracker for personal use

@date=2021-08-15
@tags=getting-things-done,scrum

![[2021-08-15-11-30-33.png]]

Having a family, side projects, main work, hobbies, etc can just be too much to keep track of, and also to allot time to. How often do you say "I'll do X around the house" and you just never get around to it.

Recently I have fallen in love with Pivotal Tracker for work purposes in managing tasks, and have replaced my text based task tracking system with PT for my personal life. What is nice about PT is you don't decide what you can accomplish in a sprint, it tells you based upon the average of your velocity in previous sprints. You can resort the backlog to prioritize things, but the sprint end marker will still just envelope a certain number of points.

Put too many things in your sprint, and you might not get to the things you wanna do, but you can easily see that happen before the week starts.

To make things better from a planning point of view, I add 7 epochs labeled Monday, Tuesday, ...Sunday. I put them in the sprint so I can figure out what I am going to do that day, and mark the day as done when all the tasks are done that day.

Lots of labels are used for what kind of things that need to be done, and all this helps me balance work, fun, chores, etc.

The mobile app for PT is pretty snappy, and allows for the creation of stories without any details really quickly, and puts them at the top of the backlog, making it a handy todo list app.

You can also use PT workspaces to see a combined view of different projects and your personal tasks, but I found it more clunky, and just create clone of work tasks in my personal tasks project.

## On typescript

@date=2021-08-15
@tags=typescript,webdev

![[2021-08-15-11-32-29.png]]

After working with typescript a lot on work projects, I typically skip it on personal projects as it just seems tedious at times.

Well, I just threw it into the neverall project while working on an alerting system, and by golly did it help clean up some things.

The issues I find are related to the type "any", which seems like sacrilege to use in projects, and for good reason. In a big team, it is easy for an individual contributor to fly under the radar tossing any in all sorts of places.

The flip side of it is that the ROI on sorting out some type stuff is just not worth the effort. Yep, it might come bite you in the ass, but sometimes mitigating the risk just takes too long, and for personal projects, the in between of sometimes using any when you don't really care is nice.

Throw in other devs though, and banning "any" starts to look real attractive.

## Boston dynamics dancing robots

@date=2021-07-19
@tags=robots

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03QJJBN2hGI

I wonder how long it took to create this script and how much it was don't virtually without the machine, and how much of it was done directly with the machine.

These are glorious self balancing machines that have perfected the challenging AI task of physical motion. It is important to remember though, that they have no understanding of what they are doing, and the amount of work to create this dance number was mind boggling.

I could see these things dropped in a battle field, given waypoints, and objectives to shoot anything that looks humanoid or moves. They'd be dumb as dirt, but still very dangerous. It makes me want to think up what countermeasures would be effective ... false targets, traps they can't handle that humans have no trouble with, body shape camo, etc. Then there is the difficult task of taking them out as shooting at them would be marginally effective.

Other fun bits would be that they would be cheaper built and more mass produced in a war setting, but power consumption would always be a thing for them. The walking robot probably would keel over at 20 min, where the wheeled one could go much longer, but have a tougher time with rough terrain. Then there is the cost/benefit of using these vs just bombing an area. Bombs would be cheaper, so maybe this would be more of a semi-autonomous thing that went with a group of troops and kills would be more guided, and built around securing an area but without total destruction.

Communications with the devices would be key, so having soldiers close by and in the loop would be important. And of course, this tech, while impressive, will be easily replicated over time. It'll be interesting to see how forces fight against each other. Probably going after the living soldiers controlling the machines would be more effective then having machines just slug it out with each other, but then, having further tele-presense would be better, and then you come back to the distance => easier signal interference.

The paper-rock-sissors of future wars will be fascinating to those don't have to be in the thick of them.

## Pick some great colors for your website or game

@date=2021-05-25
@tags=web-design

[Cohesive colors](https://javier.xyz/cohesive-colors/) is a color palette randomizer that does a great job picking a set of 5 colors that work really well together, and also allows you to throw a hue adjustment on them all.

This would be good for a quick way to colorize game levels or websites to make them look distinctive without too much effort.

For websites, I like to come up with a set of base colors, assign them to variables, and then lighten them to various degrees to use in different contexts.

## Web based free replacement for photoshop

@date=2021-05-25
@tags=graphic-design,art

[Pixlr photo editor](https://pixlr.com/x/) really fulfills what I am looking for in a photoshop replacement without spending big bucks on what is basically 31 year old technology.

As someone who way the hell back in the late 90s liked to do silly things with mashing up different photos and doing basic things with the magic wand tool, layers, and doodling, pixlr gives me what I need. Yep, I am far from a graphic designer, and my needs are probably basic compared to professionals in the field, but as far a graphic editing ability compared to fellow programmers, I am pretty good, and I don't run up to any limitations in doing what I need with what it provides.

Each of the tools are detailed with many sliders and adjustment factors that are easily used. Layers work great as do transformations. The pen tool works great with different sizes and strength.

## One codebase to rule them all

@date=2021-05-25
@tags=web-dev,react,seo,adhd

A little over a decade ago, I went on a binge and made a bunch of web apps of various sorts:

- [EditThis.info wiki hosting](http://editthis.info)
- [Cueflash flashcards study system](http://cueflash.com)
- [ConstantSail pirate and trading game](http://constantsail.com)
- And atari combat and astroids clones
- A dice rolling program

Since then, I have built up a huge list of projects I would like to build, I get started on some of them, but then fail to get them off the ground.

Issues that I blame on this:

- I also had a messy divorce and custody struggle that for a good 6 years encompassed all of my attention (and a good chunk of $money), making it pretty impossible to focus on anything else, and really got me out of my routine for doing side projects
- Being overcommitted to work
- [decision paralysis](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidsturt/2015/06/11/decision-paralysis-why-its-prevalent-and-3-ways-to-end-it/?sh=1ad1dd1735b2) - that big list of ideas is so big it has it's own organization structure. Settling down with one idea is really challenging
  - I am ADD as all hell (like 100% on most tests)... hence the giant list of ideas
- The startup to any project involves too much overhead to keep me involved.
  Ok, I am working my normal job, and I am creating a new project: creating the css, the layout, the database, the authentication system, the different pages, etc, and by the time I get to the meat of what makes something unique, I am on to the next project.

The first of these bullets is "resolved", the middle ones aren't really resolvable, but that last one, I think that is tackle-able, and able to be handled with my scattered mind.

So I created a website called [neverall.com](http://neverall.com) (the domain name was from a [domain name generator](http://mixmatch.com) I created called mixmatch.com that helps you find short domain names). I also created a single create-react-app repo for neverall.com, and am using it for a rebuild of the [godot asset store](http://godotassetstore.org). Instead of creating a bunch of domain names and a bunch of git repos and separate projects, I am going to build one site to rule them all, and everything will just be basically a "subdirectory" of neverall.com. This will have a few benefits:

- All of the basic site setup stuff will always be there, so it will be easy to just create a new directory and use the same common db for all of them
- Improvements to the design and components can be done all in one place, and so everything gets a face lift (though I do like individual projects to have their own look and feel)
- A little SEO hacking as projects on different domain names don't share page rank, so my projects don't really help eachother out much, except for interlinking.

This last point is an interesting one, as it is nice to tell people, check out someCoolWebApp.com instead of neverall.com/someCoolWebApp.

The thing is, both are things that can be done at the same time. Using nginx, I can point all of the domain names to the same code base, but when you go to someCoolWebApp.com, it will show you the same content as neverall.com/someCoolWebApp, and this can all be handled in the React router code (I use reach router, which is awesome).

Now, duplicate content on the internet is a big SEO no-no, and google will ding you hard for it. Also, all that SEO juice flowing to someCoolWebApp.com doesn't benefit the collections of other apps that I am building. ... except it can!

[Canonical URLs](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/crawling/consolidate-duplicate-urls) are things you can put in the head of your site documents. They tell google where the "real" original content is, and so that real content gets the SEO page ranking rather than wherever people are linking to. So I can tell everyone all about someCoolWebApp.com, and they can all be lining to it, but really neverall.com/someCoolWebApp.com gets all the benefits.

Another side benefit is that since everything is in one repo, I can bounce around between directories, reuse components, and work on whatever I feel tickles my fancy any day without having to decide what repo to work on and just being stuck on that. I can start writing code anywhere for anything and it will be useable without needing to start up much or even finish anything at any time.

All in all, an experiment into ADD programmer side project productivity. Maybe I will update you here on the progress... or maybe I will just be creating things.

## Standardizing portable board games

@date=2021-04-23
@tags=3d-printing,boardgames

I have a bit of a thought that 3d printing boardgames would be great, particularly portable ones with
nice cases.

For sizing, I am thinking of basing it off of the [iso 216 paper sizing formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_216). Most people will think of this relating to the A4 printer paper size.

The reason for focusing on this format is that is a standard that works well with doubling. There are 3 sizings in this iso standard. A, B and C. For reasons that I am not sure I fully know, B is the biggest of the lines, and then C, and then A. What is nice about this, is if we use size B6 for a standard sized box, it is 125mm x 176mm, and A6 paper is 105mm x 148mm. This means the box will fall nicely inside the print sizes for most printers, and make it possible to print pieces beside the box so things can be printed in one shot, and A6 paper can be used as the print size for instructions. A6 paper can be made by cutting an A4 sheet into quarters, so instructions could be print on A4 and then cut into 4.

The boxes will have an overhang at the top so that game boards can be stacked. The lid can be a simple circle with a finger hole in the middle.

![Diagram with lips on 4 sides](2021-04-23-17-09-31.png)

One issue is that with this being the size of a b6, two b7's couldn't fit inside since the lips would push up against each other. One way to remedy this is to only have two sides of each box have lips on that stick out on the sides like so:

![Diagram with lips on 2 sides](2021-04-23-17-24-28.png)

So two half sized boxes can fit into a rim of a lower box and then they can tightly stack on top of each other.

Alternative idea: have no sides stick out, and then have pegs that stick out of the top of each lid that fit into holes in the bottom of the box above it. The floor thickness would need to be such that it can accommodate that.

This might be simpler, and as long as the hole sizes are big enough that they don't grip the peg below. This can create issues though as having holes on the bottom of models can create issues.

## Coding productivity

@date=2020-12-04
@tags=programming

One thing that I find that helps is to open up a text file and start typing what your thoughts are and be unfiltered (I sometimes look away from my screen so I don't proofread). Try and get everything out, and let yourself brainstorm.

Keeping it all in a conversation in your head creates too many threads to keep track of and you end up looping around worrying about this or that.
Then after that, I take the blob of text and try to organize it into categories such as "issues to resolve", "action items", … etc

Writing also slows down your thoughts a bit and keeps you from bouncing too much.

I also have a thing on my desk that I do rubber duck debugging with:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging

I also turn this app on when I am trying to force myself to be productive:
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/loud-typer/id1493508558?mt=12

and this for music:

The sound of the typing makes me feel more productive, which reinforces it, and the music gives me a rhythm.

## Game performance by tag and modding

This is a [great article about what games perform well on steam based upon their tags (categories)](https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/DannyWeinbaum/20191115/353349/Genre_Viability_on_Steam_and_Other_Trends__An_Analysis_Using_Review_Count.php).

Some games like strategy war games, which I have a great love for, make great money, and there are also very few of them. Other games like puzzlers are plentiful and don't make much. He also goes into the normal lifespan of a game and its revenue stream which tapers off after 5 years.

There were so many good tidbits in there, and even a multipage spreadsheet of useful sales data, which is like gold now that steamspy can no longer function.

One thing that seems to really make great money is the tag "moddable." Definitely not easy to do in something like godot (or anything else for that matter) but it seems to make a big impact on profitability.

## Bringing things under one roof

@date=2020-10-20
@tags=webdev,seo

This is a great article about using subdomains vs subfolders for seo:

[subdomains vs subfolders](https://www.seoquake.com/blog/subdomains-vs-subfolders/)

I looks pretty clear that subfolders are the way to go.

With a single server with nginx on it, you can reverse proxy to multiple servers using the location /somedirectory tag.

I am pondering the idea of making a bunch of mini apps, and then having them all under one domain (maybe this one) and then using subdirectories rather than creating separate names domains for everything. As of right now, this site is just me talking to myself as viewership is basically nil.

As I am coming back to working on instaboardgame, maybe it should be under tentoncreations.com/fun/boardgame. Cueflash.com could go under tentoncreations.com/flashcards. Constantsail.com could go under tentoncreations/fun/constantsail.

Editthis.info/create_your_own_adventure -> tentoncreations.com/wiki/create_your_own_adventure

and so on.

I might not want to do that with editthis.info as the content on there can be adult in nature, and would make it so google adsense wouldn't be allowed on the other sites.

This blog could end up going under /blog, or just stay at the root.

I was also messing around with [wordoid](https://wordoid.com/) trying to come up with something shorter than TenTonCreations.com. It is a tough call as that is a pretty long domain name, but it is easy to spell, and I think sounds pretty cool. It also makes more sense then undrix.com or lagon.com (two examples of available domain names). The choices between short and meaningful is a tough one with domain names.

Some sites I am thinking would be good to build: a site for feedback.

## The uneasy peace of nuclear weapons.

@date=2020-10-13
@tags=war,politics

Just some thoughts I had after watching this video:

Simulation of a Nuclear Blast in a Major City

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3RzNEzJyzo&ab_channel=NeilHalloran

Nuclear weapons are the reason we haven't had multiple world wars since WWII. The game mechanics of warfare changed when any major conflict could lead to complete annihilation on both sides.

All wars since then have only be proxy wars through countries that are not nuclear armed. It makes it clear why countries such as NK and Iran would like to have these weapons. It makes them essentially un-invadable.

It reminds me of the movie bedazzled. I could imagine someone war-weary after WWII making a deal with the devil to make it so no major war won't happen again in their lifetime, and the wish was granted with nukes.

I wonder how many lives were saved by making the cold war not a hot war thanks to nukes, and if long run the debt of saving all those lives will have to be paid in full plus interest.

## Thoughts on using grommet for web app design

@date=2020-10-08
@tags=web-dev,design,react

I used [Grommet](https://icons.grommet.io/) for a react project, and here are some of my thoughts on it.

Things I like

- Works out of the box for most use cases
- Nice for form elements
- Gives a standard look and feel for the site without any need to work out details

Things I don't like

- A grommet element is a wrapper for an entire dom structure that you can't directly style as it doesn't have any classes you can apply css to; a simple parent classname that you can have as a starting point would work wonders
- The Box wrapper and other wrappers for grid layouts just reimplement html features but in a more limited and difficult to adjust way
- It basically sucks for doing anything new stylistically (such as building a static landing page).
- It's design is kinda bla and minimal as far as customization

If I were to do a application in the future I would:

- I'd still use grommet for all of its components, but not it's layout
- Create a thin layer interface over grommet that just passes down props. This way a mvp can be quickly pushable, but the styles would be easily updatable
  - But more likely, unless styles don't matter at all, I would just do my own component library based on mocks as really stying components isn't too hard

Well structured scss is really easy to manage, and while grommet is good for building quick and dirty UI, scss custom built ui components are better to build for a project that is going to be something that will be used for a long term project.

## Next.js vs Create-React-App

When doing react, I have on worked with CRA up until now. I just took over a next.js app, and when built and deployed, it is speedy, but didn't like some of the details of development:

- myApp/pages/page-name/index.js is how you create a route for /page-name. While quick and friendly, I prefer the following:
  - Defining my own route rules in details with reach-router. I am just to particular about routing to accept the trade off of simplicity against customizability. Also, defining routes is simple, and it is good for rearranging things without renaming components.
  - I really don't like dozens of index.js files in my codebase. I prefer to call pages pages/page-name/page-name.js so it is clear by the file name what things are for.
- making changes when development are a little fluky when it comes to live updates, css doesn't seem to live update nicely, and there are just too many times that I have to kill the server and restart it to see my changes. This is even worse because it all seems unpredictable as to if/when changes would appear and a little frustrating

These are little nitpicks, and if CRA didn't exist, I would go with next, but I love the way CRA is more customizable regarding routing, and is just snappy for responsiveness. I also feel there is just too much gray area as to if something is being rendered on the server or the client, and as an ex-apache/php guy, I really am not a fan of worrying about server side rendering anymore.

The case where I would likely use next would be if I were building a static content based site where SEO and first page load times were everything. I also know gatsby is supposed to be good for this too, so I would do some side by side comparisons. Also SEO with react is pretty good as is.

In the end though, that isn't really something I do much of, so I'll be on CRA for the forseeable future.

## 7 days away from the time wasting websites

@date=2020-10-07
@tags=productivity

I have a problem with time wasting websites such as youtube, facebook, twitter, etc. I start going down rabbit holes that suck away my work day.

As such, I am putting all social media sites on a 7 day time out. I have added them all to my /etc/hosts file so that visiting them just goes to an error.

Also, installed the mac app called "Time Out" which every hour forces me to take a 10 minute break, during which I am allowing myself some time to work on my current task list, draw pictures, play piano, or write articles like this in my blog (the app covers the screen with a semi-transparent image making it so you can't click a mouse, but you can type, which is great a forcing what kind of things I can do).

The idea being that taking 10 minutes out of my day to unfocus from work will allow me to think a little more, and instead of distracting myself with social media, I can do something a little more meditative.

## Cloudflare effects on users

@date=2020-09-22
@tags=editthis.info,web-development

For the last few years I have been using cloudflare in front of editthis.info. On the 21st I dropped it, and saw an immediate decrease in average load times (from google analytics):

![[2020-09-22-15-12-53.png]]

This was without any changes to the system at all, and with about 800-900 active users per day.

Also, as mentioned in my previous blog post, in cloudflare's dashboard, it reports a massive number of malicious attacks that they have thwarted.

![[2020-09-21-10-26-35.png]]

These are either inflated numbers, or more worrying actual users who couldn't get past their overly vigorous captcha screening process.

I look forward to seeing how this effects user counts overall - some could be from the speed boast and some from lack of captchas. In either case, I won't be using cloudfront again. I am going to set up a simple nginx proxy in front of the website, and implement some caching there to help increase the speed even further.

## Disney during covid

@date=2020-09-22
@tags=vacation,covid

My wife and I went to Disneyworld for our honeymoon this month and it was fantastic. Due to pandemic fears, flights were super cheap, the disney resort was discounted and nearly empty, and lines were nearly non-existent at the parks. Most rides were about a 5 minute wait, with some of the more popular attractions taking about 30 minutes. Compared to a typical 1hr+ for wait times for major rides, this meant going through a lot of rides was a breeze.

Some downsides:

- Masks weren't pleasant in the Florida heat, but some light cloth ones worked out ok.
- The parks closed early, so they were only open about 8 hrs, which means you can't be to leisurely about trying to hit all the attractions
- due to social distancing, restaurants cannot handle many customers, and so getting reservations for everything is required
- Most of the small food places were closed, and walking with food was not allowed
- No end of day fireworks since parks closed early
- No live shows
- Apparently no housecleaning for the rooms
- Small kids have to wear masks. Seriously, 2 year olds are being required to wear masks.

The upside of being able to practically have the park for yourself is great though, and worth the tradeoff if you aren't bringing little kids with you. We'll be taking them to Disney sometime after the world stops being ruled by hypochondriacs.

## Editthis.info overhaul

@date=2020-09-21
@tags=editthis.info,completed-projects

[EditThis.info](http://Editthis.info) has long been overdue for an upgrade. I've been postponing it for a while, and now that I have just finished a big move, a wedding, and a honeymoon in Disney (covid be damned), I am circling back on it.

Task list (this article will be updated as things are completed):

- [x] Clone current server instance
- [ ] Remove cloudfront - it constantly causes problems, and I think it is blocking a lot of users worldwide that it considers "malicious"
- [ ] Set dev.editthis.info to new server instance
- [ ] Add nginx with caching (this will hopefully fulfill the role of cloudflare better as I can customize it as needed)
- [ ] upgrade php
- [ ] upgrade mediawiki
  - [ ] Convert an absurd of dbs to the new mediawiki db structure
- [ ] Point editthis.info to new server

Along the way I expect a lot of hick-ups and course corrections, but EDI is a very active site despite it's poor network performance. I think it is reasonable to expect that with a bit of an overhaul I can achieve a 10x increase in usage, which would make it much more lively than it is now.

Screenshot showing how much cloudflare is blocking (basically a count of failed or skipped annoying captchas): ![[2020-09-21-10-26-35.png]]

## Instaboardgame.com - play board games instantly with friends

@date=2020-09-03
@tags=instaboardgame,in-progress-projects

[Instaboardgame](http://instaboardgame.com) will be a place for people to instantly play and create boardgames with their friends wherever they may be.

Think of it like a big box of board game pieces that you can pull out and start playing with.

To start with, you create a table, then you can either import in a prebuilt game, or you can
pull out pieces and drop them in, and you and others who have joined can start playing with them.

Only the table creator needs to have an account, and users can just join with the private share link that the creator provides.

Table creators can have up to one free table per account, and that table will maintain it's state for up to 1 week. If you have a subscription, you can have up to 5 tables and they will maintain their state for as long as you like. If you have a pro account, you can have up to 100 tables that you can manage, and you can set users to be admins of the tables. This is ideal for tournaments.

I use rss feeds, reddit, twitter, news sites, etc, etc, but the most distilled grouping of great new things to read on the web regarding programming, science, design, and many other things is [Hacker Newsletter](https://www.hackernewsletter.com/). It is a weekly email newsletter that is a curated list of the best stuff that appears on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). The trouble with hacker news is there is too much content and the top list of articles are by popularity rather than quality, so it provides lots of distraction, but without the focus on substance. Hacker newsletter fixes that with some excellent curation.

## Shareable web based boardgame update

@date=2020-06-04
@tags=instaboardgame,in-progress-projects

[Last month](http://tentoncreations.com/a/Started-on-a-shareable-web-based-boardgame-system/) I made a doodle post of an idea for an instant online board game system.

Well, progress is coming along fast:

![[2020-06-04-15-12-03.png]]

So far I have:

- a react site which directs [/game/test](https://instaboardgame.com/game/test) to a test boardgame
- Websocket connection where you can move around game piece elements
- A component hierarchy where every piece type passes props down to possibly other piece types, to then load in the Piece component. This should allow for a rapid development of lots of types of pieces, as the details of each are just specifying what makes it different from a different piece. Examples:
  - Chess pieces would remove other pieces from the board if you put one on top of another
  - Clicking cards will flip them over
  - clicking decks will pull a card from an array of cards and put it on top of the deck
  - clicking on a dice box will roll the dice, and there will be an area to manipulate what dice are in the box
- A json structure for a game where piece components are specified, and the props that go down to them
- A reducer coding system which will minimize the size of updates coming from connected clients

Current tasks:

- [ ] Authentication
- [ ] Membership - allow access to premium games and ability to have more than 2 tables
- [ ] Create game table
- [ ] Auto save games to mongo
- [ ] Load and unload games from memory
- [ ] Set your player #, icon, color, and name (allow spectators?)
- [ ] Show hidden hand for player
- [ ] Drag/drop pieces onto table

## Setup ssl websockets from node using nginx and certbot

@date=2020-06-04
@tags=nginx,nodejs,web-development,instaboardgame,websockets

![[2020-06-12-08-30-59.png]]

Certbot is the tool from [letsencrypt.org](https://letsencrypt.org) that lets you generate ssl certificates for your site without having to pay the likes of Verisign ever again. Basically I love the heck out of them for what they do.

Nginx runs on your server to redirect examplesite.com to localhost:1234 if you happen to be running your node express server on that port.

Now if you want to have a socket connection to your server to receive constant updates(for example if you are building an [online sandbox styled board game system](https://instaboardgame.com)) you could use the npm module `ws` to create that websocket for your javascript code to connect to on some port, such as port 8080. This however will not be encrypted, and it will also be kinda ugly and not firewall friendly since it isn't running on a standard open port.

But you can run all that through nginx so that you get to have ssl encryption and also use the same port as your node.js express server.

### How to do it

For the client side javascript, you can route your calls to wss://examplesite.com/websocket

- In the nginx config, set up the connection to close when header is set to ''.
- create an upstream to your websocket port
- add the /websocket location

```

map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
    default upgrade;
    '' close;
}

upstream websocket {
   server 127.0.0.1:8080;
}

server {
    server_name examplesite.com;
    location /websocket {
            proxy_pass http://websocket;
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
    }

# after this is just an example of the rest of the nginx config for a node server on 8675
# that has a static build directory (for react or whatever)
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8675;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
    location ~ \.(gif|jpg|png|js|txt|html|mp3|css|woff2)$ {
        root /root/examplesite.com/build/;
        expires 30d;
    }

    listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/examplesite.com/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/examplesite.com/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot

}
```

You can use https://www.npmjs.com/package/wscat to test out your local ws://...:8080 and your wss://.../websocket connection, and both should now return the same thing.

## 1000 Blank White cards sounds like a fun game

@date=2020-05-20
@tags=boardgames

![](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/itemrep/img/4qsEyUFfqBt4GtsJGGq0WD7YeCs=/fit-in/246x300/pic606721.jpg)
I was reading this BGG page:

https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4550/1000-blank-white-cards

And it looks like a fun game to play, especially with some jumbo index cards.

Some ideas for a good ruleset based on what I read in the forums:

- At the beginning of the first game, each player makes 6 cards and leave 4 blank cards. All cards get shuffled in. On subsequent games each player makes 4 cards, chooses 4 cards from archive, and also inserts 4 blank cards.
- Each player draws 5 cards from the deck
- The starting ruleset for the game is draw a card, play a card
- If you have a blank card in your hand, you can turn it into a new card. New cards should have a name, a drawing, a type, and a description.
  ![[From dvorakgame.co.uk.png]]
  ![](<https://cf.geekdo-images.com/imagepage/img/tv6SDSCIJyhBmUT8IV3jlKggmSE=/fit-in/900x600/filters:no_upscale()/pic377521.jpg>)
- The game ends when there is no cards left to draw
- Each card is one of the following types:
  - **action** - do what it says and then discard it
  - **thing** - modifies a player state (add/subtract from score score or giving a special ability). Place in front of you (keeper) or another player (giver)
  - **modifier** can be played on things to change them - such as give them armor, make them bald, fast, green. Could change values of the card it is modifying
  - **new rule** - change how the game is played
- Point values for things can range from -100 to +100
- Actions are usually discarded after play
- Cards can have suits (I am thinking colored stampers) and colors which makes it so they can be targeted by other cards.
- No skip turn cards - seems to be the least fun cards

## An attempted simple guide for react hooks.

@date=2020-05-14
@tags=react,programming,guides

![[2020-05-14-14-46-05.png]]

React hooks is what got me to actually like React enough to make it my primary web development framework (at least at this date). They break away from the ugly class based heavily nested object form of React, and make it truly more functional, while giving allowances for managing state in a stateless system.

The first thing to grasp about react is that components re-render with every change in the props that come into them, and thus every time they are run (which is every time an input changes), all internal values are wiped out. It should also be noted that internal hook state changes also trigger these re-renders.

The following hooks help keep all of this from getting washed away with each re-render so that your components can continue to function.

### useState

This one you will likely use the most.

`const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);`

Sets a value for the initial state, and gives you something to update that state with `setState`.

Updating the state will cause a rerender, but the state value will be maintained.

Note that the left hand side of the equal sign is an array, not an object. state and setState are variables that you make up, and could be called anything, and it is really the order of the outputs from useState that causes state and setState to be set correctly. For example:

`const [burgersAreDoneCooking, setBurgersAreDoneCooking] = useState(false);`

Would be how you would track the state of the burgers in your cooking app.

### useContext

This can be used to subscribe to a context value set higher up in the tree.

```
function Grandparent() {
  const [favoriteColor, setFavoriteColor] = useState('blue');
  return (
    <FavoriteColor.Provider value={favoriteColor}>
      <Parent />
    </FavoriteColor.Provider>
  );
}
function Parent(){
  return (
    <div>
      <Grandchild />
    </div>
  );
}
function Grandchild(){
   const grandpasFavColor = useContext(FavoriteColor);
   return (<div>My grandpa's favorite color is {grandpasFavColor}</div>)
}
```

### useReducer

Outputs a state and a dispatcher. The dispatch is a function that will call the reducer with the current state and an action, and that reducer then returners an entirely new object that is a mutation of the original state to provide a new state value.

```
const initialState = {count: 0, otherValues:['a', 'b', 'c']};

function countReducer(state, action){
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return {...state, count:state.count+1};
    case 'decrement':
      return {...state, count:state.count-1};
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
  return (
    <>
      Count: {state.count}
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({type:'decrement'})}>-</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({type:'increment'})}>+</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

### useEffect

This is run after the page renders, and if you leave out the dependency array, it will rerun every single time. Usually you only want this to run once though, so setting it to depend on some variables changing, or at a minimum, just passing it [] as the second parameter will keep it from repeatedly running

```
useEffect(
  () => {
    /*Do something just once after rendering, unless depends array changes*/
  },
  [somethingToDependOn],
);
```

### useMemo

Only re-run when the dependency changes. This is useful for expensive calculations. It can be used as a watcher for a dependency that will then cause a function to run.

```
largestPrime = useMemo(
() => calculateLargestPrimeOfNumber(newNumber),
[newNumber]
);
```

This will update the messageHistory every time a new value comes in for lastMessage

### useRef

```
const refContainer = useRef(initialValue);
```

Returns an object with a property .current that you can mutate whenever. The object will persist and so you get to keep access to current. This is sometimes used with

`<div ref={yourRefObj}>`. When react rerenders the dom, it will reapply your object to it, and your yourRefObj.current will always point to the dom element

### useCallback

Stores a callback on a variable so you can use it on children elements and won't cause a render of the children for every time the parent changes. Since in the below, the reference to onChildChange always stays the same on re-renders, it makes it so \<Child\> doesn't detect a change in it's passed in values.

We use "a" as a dependency so that the callback is updated when the state of "a" is updated.

```
function Parent({ ... }) {
  const [a, setA] = useState(0);
  const onChildChange = useCallback(() =>
   {doSomething(a);}, [a]);
  ...
  return (
  ...
    <Child onChange={onChildChange} >
  );
}
```

### Some others

I skipped useImperativeHandle, useLayoutEffect, useDebugValue as those are rarely used. You can read [the documentation about them here.](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html)

## Some quotes from the Art of Manliness blog

@date=2020-05-07
@tags=quotes

Make hay while the sun shines.

- I think of this as a partly as keeping your eyes open to when the sun shines... which is when opportunities exist... and actually taking advantage of the situation. This is always a challenge because you have to act and act quickly, when it is so much easier to let the opportunity slide.

A boy will dabble in a thousand pursuits and then drop them when he gets bored or they become too difficult. A man will always finish what he starts.

- This one I disagree with. I like to go with Adam Savage's style where he has multiple projects going simultaneously, and just jumping on what interests you, even if it means having a dozen half completed things. This makes it so something is always moving forward, you are following your passions, and you don't get into creative blocks. This only applies to creative pursuits, and for those, it is when you switch to another task, not when you just walk away from doing anything to watch tv.

Make it your goal to have your children say about you what Theodore Roosevelt said about his father: "My father was the best man I ever knew. He combined strength and courage with gentleness, tenderness, and great unselfishness. He would not tolerate in us children selfishness or cruelty, idleness, cowardice, or untruthfulness.

- Love this. It gives a solid list of traits to exemplify and be a role model for your children for.

If we play'em 10 times, they might win 9. But not this game. Not tonight.

- Even when the odds are against you, remember that sometimes luck is on your side, and you can make some of your own luck. Sometimes you have to accept that failure is the norm, but going into an area where failure is the norm can provide major upsides and enjoyment and growth.

## Weighted Task Chooser

@date=2020-04-09
@tags=projects,launched

![[2020-06-12-08-34-20.png]]

[Weighted task chooser](https://github.com/RobKohr/weighted-task-chooser) is a command line node script that will select a randomly weighted task to do out of a tasklist markdown file.

So you have a list of tasks to do in a markdown file:

- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
- [4] Task 3
  - [ ] Subtask of 3
- [ ] Task 4
      Some notes on task 4
- [x] Task 5 - done, don't every pick this
- [ ] Task 6

This will randomly choose one of the parent tasks from that file. It also does weighting, where each task has a default weight based on the value in the brackets.

## WET vs DRY coding

@date=2020-04-09
@tags=programming

![[2020-06-12-08-35-31.png]]

This is roughly a reply to/inspired by [Write everything twice, just not a third time.](https://dev.to/wuz/stop-trying-to-be-so-dry-instead-write-everything-twice-wet-5g33)

This is really a heavy "it depends". The goals of making it so you have one source of things to be debugged and modified are great when we are talking about a decent number lines of code (or more importantly conceptual pieces). The other side of things is that DRY pushes to creating modules/components/functions that are nameable sections of code that increases readability of the code. An example of this is to take 20 lines of code that does one "Thing", and replace it with a function call to Thing() that contains those 20 lines. Yeah, you don't save anything as far as line count of code, but you make it so when reading things, you don't have to parse apart the functionality of that 20 lines, and you can test it and know you never need to think about it again besides calling it's name.
The DRY to WET side of things start to slip over to the wet side (pun intended) when the cost of making it DRY and the ongoing costs of the DRY structure is more then just leaving it wet. This typically comes from when over-engineering leads to a tower of babel like structure of things wrapping things wrapping things to the point where it becomes challenging to make a change:
Having to digest the stack to understand the inner parts to find out where a change needs to happen
Dealing with the unintended consequences of the change on other parts of the system (regression)
Being straight-jacketed by a structure meant to be general purpose using parameters, but doesn't quite match what you need and leading to further changes to the abstraction to meet the new need.
This last one is the one that leads to the most challenges and much of what the time is spent on large developed systems.

## Using 5x8 index cards for random notes and ideas

@date=2020-03-30
@tags=index-cards,writing

I started working with using index cards for writing ideas similar to the slipcard (Zettelkasten Method). I started working with 3x5's but found they were too small to write ideas on. Now I am using 5x8's. This works well, because I use them in portrait orientation and they fit in the [box I got for them](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XZ3B7F2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1). I also got some [heavy duty cards](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0784FP7BW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) that stand up well in the box and are nice to write on.

Here is the first card in the box. Instead of using it as an index, I am using the first one as a list of ideas for what cards could be; this is helpful as it is always the card that is visible in front of the stack.

![[2020-03-30-16-17-51.png]]

So far I have made about 15-20 cards, and most are ending up under number 4 (following the system, things under 4 would be 4a, 4b, ...etc) which is where software ideas go. I don't know if this is a great choice compared to always tacking a new idea or concept at the end of the stack. The downside might be that I am always inserting most of the cards at that point as most of my ideas are software ideas. The upside is that I can have them always together so I can flip through them to see what I wanna work on next.

I have this blog, which is generated from a blog.md file. I recently got index cards and am trying to figure out how to incorporate them in some way.

Creating a pattern to writing is the tricky part. It takes repetition and a desire to do it... kinda like exercise.

Using a long notebook file has made it easier to keep track of what I need to do each day. On any day I grab things from the backlog, and stick them under the header for today's date. Then I checkmark competed items. Incomplete items just move to the next day (or back to the backlog).

Perhaps a react app for the phone would be ideal for this?

## FAANGs are sucking us dry

@date=2020-02-22
@tags=business,startups
![[2020-06-12-08-42-12.png]]
The FAANG's of the world are doing us a big disservice. They filter out the best of the best programmers in the world, and then shackle them with 300K+ golden handcuffs to work on meaningless tasks on already developed products.

I was talking with a recruiter many years back about when Yahoo had a massive layoff. The following year, he was suddenly awash with jobs to fill with new startups that were created by these Yahoo employees that were in comfy jobs for life.

If one of the FAANG companies laid off their workers, we would have a huge tech boom as these brilliant people suddenly would be forced to either get another job, or create something new, and that percentage of people that would create something new would rock the world. We would have new innovations across the board in IT and other fields that they would apply their talents to.

Instead, they are building plumbing in a system that really is just in maintenance mode. Remember, 99% of the functionality of these systems that exist today was already in existence 5 years go for them. This swarm of high priced talent is basically just moving the needle about 1-2% per year to just stay ahead of any other potential competitor.

The trouble is that these companies are so successful, that they can burn the cash trapping talent, and still pull in billions per year. This grind for small returns is just a small line item compared to the flood of cash they all rake in.

So as weird as it sounds, I think the world would be so much better off if these big companies lay of the majority of their engineers.

[Octomaze](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.octagon.octomaze) is a A good puzzler that gets you thinking, is challenging, but not so much that I have gotten stuck yet.

The mechanics and style of this game concept are great, but what really makes this shine is how much obvious thought the dev put into the level design, which progresses with a smooth increase in difficulty.

I just bought the full version after beating the demo, and it gets even better after that. New themes, dangers and enemies come in world two.

## On game design: make them cry

@date=2019-11-26
@tags=game-design,other-peoples-projects,game-review

![nes-cry](nes-cry.jpg)

I was talking with [@octagon_game_st](http://twitter.com/octagon_game_st) about his game [Octomaze](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.octagon.octomaze_demo)

I didn't finish the demo, and well, I figured I should paste it in as I think it is a good breakdown of game design for a mechanics based puzzle:

---

I didn't finish the demo, and it didn't entice me enough to go back in and do so, and I have been thinking about why exactly that is.

I always liked the game mechanics of the early nes games. They introduced a simple mechanic, and then for a stretch introduced no other mechanics, but just kept on increasing the difficulty in that one mechanic before it got really hard, and then once it got hard, the dropped the difficulty and threw another mechanic at you and repeated the cycle.

It seems you put a lot of the mechanics in the first levels (I only went up till the buttons with the wall turns), so you were giving a lot of the goods first without the users earning/trying at all, where the new mechanics should be considered the reward. Otherwise it is like they already know everything that the game is going to provide, and now it is just going to keep getting harder. The reward shouldn't be the puzzles, but the novelty of a new way to work through puzzles.

And ramp that difficulty up faster.

Example level plan:

- Mechanic level (just simple navigating a maze- then 2 levels of difficulty to very hard
- another mechanic level - a level that mixes that with the first mechanic, then a really hard level with the two

Then continue.

Keep in mind your target audience:

- Mobile, so they want something engaging fast
- Smart, or at least they think so, since they are choosing a puzzle game. Don't coddle them. Make them hate you and want to throw their phone within the first minute. If they wanted to just plod along, they would have chosen candy crush.
- Distracted, so once they pick their phone back up and check it for cracks, and beat that 3rd level that shouldn't have been so damn hard, you give them a new mechanic to chew on.

Give them 3 mechanics (maze moving, buttons, then a challenging monster... not a simple one) and 3 levels on each making the last one of each pain inducing, and then hit them with a paywall to go get the full version chumps where the octopus will make you cry for momma, if you think you can handle it. Be a little rude, have some fun with the players. When you play test you should see them fluxuate between happiness and suffering.

## Angular is just easier to make most web applications in than React

@date=2019-11-25
@tags=angular,react

UPDATE: My feelings about this have changed quite a bit, a follow up article is to come. The summary is that React has gotten so much easier with React hooks that my recommendations here have changed.

### A little background

I did about 5 years of AngularJS (not newer Angular) development, 1.5 years of React, and now about 1 month of Angular, so I know my around a little bit of the the first two, and now with I have touch a bit on the third (I consider Angular and AngularJS to be fairly distant cousins).

### What sets them apart

My impression is that React is a tidy powerful, elegant, and well engineered project that can suit practically any need, but especially that of a very unique web application that needs to be tackled creatively and with very modular code. It really delivers on the promise of functional programming, and is a joy to code with.

That said, you have to do a fair amount of thinking and planning with React.

### Where Angular thrives

Angular (and AngularJS), you don't have to think so much as just do. There really is not a huge variety in how you would slice up and build a web application with Angular, and that is nice when you are building 95% of the web applications out there on the internet. Do you need something with a load of interlinked web pages, where you can view data loaded from an API and occasionally submit some data back to said APIs. Well, then you have a friend in Angular.

The lack of thought needed in such an opinionated framework is that makes it ideal, and it satisfies so many application needs, because frankly, as someone who has spent most of his life building web applications used by millions of people, all the apps start looking pretty damn much the same when you break them down to their basic functional parts.

![time to make the donuts](donuts.jpg)

### Exceptions: where React thrives

![genie](genie.jpg)

Exceptions to this are more application type apps: web games, gmail, facebook, slack, google docs, twitter, photo editing, experimental stuff, etc.

Basically things where the concepts of pages are meaningless, and interactions are fluid and different than the standard [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create%2C_read%2C_update_and_delete) based web web apps.

I feel Angular and React can fullfil both basic CRUD apps and more interactive application type apps, but each are much better suited to their the specific app type with React being more flexible

### Top down vs bottom up

Another little bit with the differences is with Angular, it seems to make more sense to build full pages from the top level, and then split them into components with services and you move through each of the pieces, where react you seem to build up more a lot of components to put things together.

### Conclusion

I like React better, but when I just need to get the job done and do it fast, and the job is pretty straight forward, Angular is the tool I would reach for first.

## Domain names are too cheap

@date=2019-11-23
@tags=domains,things-that-piss-me-off

It is way too difficult to find a domain that isn't being squatted on. Take any two random words in the dictionary, put them together for a domain name, and some squatter will own it.

As painful as it would be to raise prices, a domain name should be $100 per year rather than $10. This would destroy squatters business model as it would price them out of spamming the whole registry. The registries of course have no incentive to do this as they would rather sell 10000 domains for $10 than 10 domains for $100, so my dream of picking a relevant domain name for a project will just stay that, a dream.

Shameless plug: if you are having trouble coming up with a domain name, try the thing I made to deal with this problem, [mix match domains](https://mixmatchdomains.com).

## USB micro and usb c Magnetic Charging Cables

@date=2019-11-22
@tags=shopping,reviews,amazon

![magnetic usb cables](usb.jpg)
I have a bunch of devices that use micro-usb, and as such I have chargers for them everywhere, but inevitably the tips on those cables start to fail, and devices have to be wiggled around and set just right to charge. On top of it, the devices themselves start to wear down at the charging point.

Well no longer!

These guys click together with some strong magnets, and start charging the first try after hundreds of connections. The ports no longer wear out in the devices, and I have yet to see the cables fail to connect and charge immediately. On top of it the charging cables become universal, so when I got a usb-c device, I just put one of the tips in, and now I can connect it easily to every port in the house (which is now fully converted to just using these cables).

They are fantastic, and you should go pick some up.

## Oculus Quest

@date=2019-11-21
@tags=vr,oculus,vive

My vive has died in all the ways:

- One lighthouse got so bad that if you faced it, it would totally lose tracking
- The audiostrap headset snapped
- The display often messed up and showed two images on one eye
- One of the controller trackpads would not click anymore
- And finally: The screen just goes black after about a minute of use. I tried a different hdmi cable and that didn't fix it.

I was reading a review that the new Vive that uses inside out tracking was performing very poorly regarding tracking, so won't be buying that as a replacement, and the Valve index is way too pricey.

So, it looks like the Quest is the machine I will be going with. This is nice, as I was never a fan of the cables attached to your head, and with [Vridge](https://riftcat.com/vridge) those PC games supposedly can be streamed to the quest. This is great because I have bought a ton of VR games on steam, and have plenty more in my wishlist.

Perhaps getting back into VR development again would be fun too. Maybe git back to making a VR swordfighting game.

## Godot languages

@date=2019-11-21
@tags=languages,localization,godot-asset-store

Looking at much of the traffic on the asset store, and non-USA visitors seem to be a big part of it (China, Russia, etc).

To satisfy this market (and target them for SEO), I will do something relating to using the google translate api to translate the various assets and text in the site. Urls will be something like
/en/assets/tag1/tag2/SomeAssetName

and english will be the default, with a page that will allow you to switch to the other languages. Asset translation will be kinda lazy done for whenever it works best for processing. Also, a link to see original language (perhaps english) will be provided.

Handling tag translation will be tricky as that is part of navigation.

## Started working on the Godot Asset store

@date=2019-10-25
@tags=godot-asset-store,started-project,projects,godot

10/25/2019 is the day I started the Godot Asset Store, and so I am inserting this entry for that day. After creating my first godot app (the tutorial dodge game), and after years of dipping my toe into Unity but never making much of anything, I see great potential in Godot.

One of the biggest pain points is that there is no commercial storefront. Yes, there is a free storefront, and with many many great open source projects, but the majority of those projects are ones that were personally made to try something out as an experiment, or to suit someone's own personal needs to finish their own game, with little long term updates and support. Yes, there are great exceptions to that, but then there are many that haven't been updated in 2 years, and aren't even compatible with the current version.

The Unity and Unreal storefronts are lively bustling communities with thousands of assets updated frequently to suit the requests of people who purchase and review those assets. Throwing in a monetary reward for developers to keep there assets improving, maintained, and version compatible is a great boon for the assets and those who depend on them.

So, I am working on the Godot Asset Store with the goal of filling that need for Godot to help it become an equal to, and one day surpass the other game development engines, because I believe in it, and feel the gaming world (both developers and players) will be better off with such a well built engine in use. I am not much of C programmer, and can't contribute much to the core of the project, but hopefully with this I will be able to help a little. I have built many of web applications, and even some e-commerce for some big companies, and it would be great to put those skills to use for this.

@tags=dreams

![[xing.jpg]]
I wrote this a long while back about a dream I had about a race that happens every year. This isn't a normal race, but one where participants can bring all manner of things to race with (skateboards, bikes, etc) but most chose to go by foot.  

The race starts in the dark of night, in a dense cityscape. The route is chosen that involves back allays, bridges, tunnels, fences, walls, and all sorts of difficult structures to cross. Some paths are down right dangerous. All of these paths are the shortest paths, where participants can take the longer slower path, avoiding danger and possible trespassing charges.  

It all started out small at first, just a group of friends just doing it for fun. But before the designated start time this year, hundreds of people crowded through the tight starting point. There was no starting gun, there was no referee. You could hear the sound of a multitude of cell phones ringing their own little alarm sound.  

People clamored over each other. People that brought bikes found that they were too cumbersome to carry over obstacles and manage in the throng of people. There were many with bruises and scratches, but no one seemed to get any broken bones this year.  

The race terminated in the industrial section of town. An area where no one was likely to call the cops for the noise, but soon enough they would show up anyway. I say terminated, because there wasn't much of a finish line. Just a band warming up. A hardcore chick beating on the drums could be heard blocks away. That was the siren call to those who lost their way.  

One or two arrived at a time, then building up to the mass that have been squeezing through the small arteries of the city, trying to get to its beating heart. They arrived grimy, beaten, and yet beaming with pride. No one noticed who actually won or lost the race, the race was with themselves. They all hovered around as more and more flowed in, and the band powered through their set. The amps were hooked up to someone's car for juice. As the guitar played its cords, the headlights dimmed with the rhythm of the music.

@tags=bitcoin

I see so many charts posted predicting the future value of bitcoin.  
  
I love it when people put lines all over price charts hoping to predict the subjective valuation of thousands of irrational actors.   
  
Trends are meaningless, and mass action will come in response to events out in the world, as well as the chaos created in the feedback loop of people adjusting their valuations based upon where they see trend lines going.   
  
Basically it all becomes a spin of the wheel, a roll of the dice, and all sorts of predicting is equivalent to rubbing a rabbit's foot. This is doubly so when all other actors have the same information that you do, and therefore come to the same conclusions you do.



## Google plus is pretty great
@date=2015-02-10
@tags=google-plus-post

Starting to re-find my love of google+. Facebook tends to just be a collection of highschool and other old friends' updates about their lives: marriage, kids, etc. It is nice to browse, but in the end I don't think I get much from it. Also, since I was in politics for a while, and made a lot of political friends, my stream is full of posts that agree with my political views, which really I would rather see more disagreement.  
  
I liked twitter for a while as the people on there weren't followed because they were friends, but because they had things to say that I wanted to learn about. The trouble is that those little snippets of text that are artificially constrained just leads to a bunch of link bait and self-promotion.   
  
Google+ is the best of both worlds. It has some IRL friends which I created a circle for, the posts are long form, and often don't require me to go off some link to find basic stuff (unless I want to read more), there isn't so much self promotion, and most importantly when I scroll through the stream I learn more, and see a great diversity of opinions.

## Teacher for all of childhood

@tags=education

It would be interesting if kindergarten teachers went with you all the way up to senior year of high school. They wouldn't just be a teacher for a grade level, but for the lifetime of a kid till they go off to college.   
  
Yep, I can see plenty of problems with this and plenty of work arounds to those problems, but it makes for a fun thought experiment.   
  
It would make it so teachers really "own" the development of their kids. Of course their would be more specialized teachers for a kid as they got older to teach them specific subject matters, but a kid would have one core teacher that would follow along with them.

## Trucrypt not secure?
@date=2014-06-03
@tags=crypto

So, Truecrypt posted that they are no longer secure anymore and you can no longer download their software and ... oh yeah, you should start using Microsoft's Bitlocker instead. Never mind that it is closed source and that MS promises that they won't put in a back door for the NSA.

The nice thing about open source software is that you don't have to trust them when they say they aren't going to put in a back door. 

It all seems pretty shady, but I have a lot of hope that some fork (perhaps http://truecrypt.ch) will do a reasonable job of maintaining the project. Especially since TrueCrypt has passed most audits. 

Trust MS to encrypt my volumes... yeah, that is not happening.

## Hurrah for price increases
@date=2014-05-13
@tags=domains

So it looks like Verisign has increased domain registration prices to over $10 for .coms:  
  
 After 7/1/2013, prices change  
    .com from $10.99 to $14.99 per year.  
    .name, .ws and .biz from $12.99 to $14.99 per year.  
    .ca from $11.99 to $14.99 per year.  
    .org, .info, .net and .us from $9.99 to $14.99 per year.  
  
Yep, this is old news, but it is _great_ news!  
  
In 2012 .coms were roughly $7, and they were $5 before that (working off of memory here)  
  
You might think I am crazy to want to spend more money on domains, but there is a reason this is awesome. It crushes domain name squatters that have registered basically every word and pair of words in the dictionary. They work on the model that they can do that, and at lets say their average resale price is $5000; at $5 they need only need  to sell 1 in every thousand name pairs that they acquire. at $10, they have to sell 1 in every 500. If prices went up to $20, they would have to sell 1 in every 250, and so on.  
  
Why do I say $5000? Well that is a number I have heard many times from these scumbags whenever I try to work out a deal with them. Probably they would take much less, but I figure it makes a good starting point to figure out what their trade off is. Unless they have [mcdonalds.com](http://mcdonalds.com), they are unlikely to get much more than that from most small businesses. So that is my magic number I use in my estimates of their risk/return.  
  
What would happen if they jacked the prices up to $100? Well, name squatters would become nearly non-existant (1 in 50 every year isn't going to happen). If this was done a decade ago, [flickr.com](http://flickr.com) would have been instead called [flicker.com](http://flicker.com) (looks like they finally bought that domain off a squatter). People wouldn't sit on names they aren't using, and the internet would have domain names that really mean something.   
  
On top of it, the .com space would be more commercial. JohnSmith.name would be used for people. .org would be used for orgs, and .net would be used for networks. Who wants to have a .com when only businesses would be using them.  
  
This is a yearly cost, and if I have a business, $100 per year is cheap to have a good name for it. $15 a year which is the proposed amount, well that is dirt cheap, and if it means a better name spaced internet, then so be it.

There have been a few android game consoles that were made by small firms and a bunch that were in "pre-launch" phases, but now the big boy has come to the table. I am going to have to re-install unity 3d and try and get something built quickly.

@tags=webdev
I used to work in e-commerce, and one term you might not heard of is called an "abandoned cart." It is when a user is about to check out, but then leaves the site. This happens frequently, and many savvy e-commerce sites try to recover these abandoned carts.

If you got through much of the process including entering your email address, and abandon, the e-commerce site might send you an email within 24 hours to recover your cart and get some discount on checkout. This happens a lot on fashion and luxury purchase websites which have big markups from their production costs, and thus they can shave off a sizable percentage and still make a profit. 

So if you are on such a website, go through to the last page of checkout, and leave. Check your email (and your spam folder the next day) and you might have a surprise waiting for you.

## Google Extension Idea: Check out elsewhere for amazon.
@date=2013-11-05
@tags=
**Google Extension Idea: Check out elsewhere for amazon.**
I use a chrome extension called "the invisible hand" which shows you what other online stores are charging in comparison to amazon. It would be great if there was an extension called "check out elsewhere" where your whole cart could be dropped onto one or more storefronts on the web for checkout elsewhere. 

Why? 

Well, amazon just like google has become the default for people to do one activity - shopping. There is a switching cost, and that is time; if I spend a lot more time shopping somewhere else I might figure out that that site is about equivalent to amazon, but it might not, so rather than investing the time, I stick with amazon. This would reduce the switching cost and prevent amazon from forming a solid monopoly on web commerce. 

I am unlikely to build this myself, but I have made some chrome extensions in the past, so if you are a hacker who would like to take the lead on developing this, I could make a significant contribution (50% of development) to making this a reality. 

If you have the urge, contact me, and we can make it happen, or just totally take the idea, and run with it yourself. That is cool by me :)

Generally, this is an invitation for others to *steal* your idea and run with it, so you must be cool with that. This could be something that could make money or just be something that would make the world a better place. You just desire to have it exist, and want someone, anyone to build it or help you build it.






## Android Bitcoin Venerability
@date=2013-08-19
@tags=google-plus-post
If you or anyone you know is using bitcoin on android, there is a issue with how android was creating random numbers which made transactions generated on android wallets vulnerable where the private keys could be reverse engineered. 

I use BitcoinSpinner, and I upgraded BitcoinSpinner, and then installed a new app from the same developer called Mycellium which seems to be a little better. I then sent all of my money to the new wallet in the Mycellium app, so it is now safe from that vulnerability. 

This only effects all of the android apps, and they all need new wallets and addresses as the previous private keys are vulnerable.

For a little background on how this could happen:

Every address has a private key which is used to control the funds in that address. Using a little crypto magic, the private key combined with a random number will create a signature for the transaction that can be verified that it comes from the owner of the public address. If you somehow knew that the random number was 123456, you can reverse the process and get the private key. The problem is with the Android random library, it has a tendency to repeatedly generate some "random numbers". Ironically the library is called SecureRandom. I think it was on the shelf next to UnsinkableShip.






## No database for node.js
@date=2013-08-15
@tags=webdev
So I have been using node.js and mongo for some time, and yeah, it works fine and all, but I am starting to wonder, why bother with a db at all?

When you are using PHP each load of a page restarts the PHP app, and the only way you can have any state stored for anything is to use some database system.

This is not the case with node.js. With that, connections just keep coming into your app, and you can maintain a set of variables for all of the information: user data, friendships, messages, etc, and you could keep it in memory. Yes you have to think carefully about this as you could go too far with data retention and your app would have to start swapping, but you would remove a whole layer of complexity to your app. 

What about when the app shuts down? Well all will be lost, but lets say you keep an object around called datastore, and that held all of your important data. It could periodically write its content to a json file which would be loaded on startup. Or you could just have a file for your users, messages, etc, so that each are treated separately. This might make them a little more manageable. You could throw in versioning, and you could also write to a temp file which would then me moved to replace the old one in case your app crashes during the write phase. 

Now you only have one process, the app, and it doesn’t need to connect or depend on anything. You can do your own quering/indexing of in memory data, and your data is just stored in human readable and easily backed up text files.






## The end of HP
@date=2013-07-15
@tags=google-plus-post

For some reason I have been thinking a lot about health bars, HP in RPGs, and RTS'

The idea of diminishing health until a character is dead just seems to be very far from reality. If you get hit by a sword or arrow or bullet, you are either critically wounded (crippled), dead, or maybe it was just a flesh wound, but it isn't like a number of successful hits lead to your death or incapacitation.

As I watch two soldiers riddle each other full of bullets while running around, I just think that something is really way off with this whole idea of health power.

It would be great when two armies clashed in an RTS game, some amount of chance, proper support and positioning, and clever strategy lead to immediate falling soldiers and incapacitated equipment. When you are playing that RPG game, you either get a critical hit on that monster, or you just happen to really piss it off (and likewise in return). When you combine weapons, skill and violence, the balance between life and death is balanced on a knife's edge and it would be great if games reflected that rather than having two orcs hit each other's heads for a full minute while someone casts healing spells on them and dragons are dropping fireballs from above. 

It is time to train more necromancers than healers.

and thinking about how google is slowly bringing about a dystopian future. Their maps app and android phone can allow you to be tracked wherever you go. Your email can easily be read by authorities, and plus to link all of your associations together. Google docs gives them a window into your business, finances, papers, and whatever you might create a spreadsheet for.  Google search can clue them in to what you are curious and thinking about. Google glass, if adopted by 0.1% of the population would provide a perfect monitoring system for crowds of people. Their automatic car driving thing they are working on for cars could one day take away your control of getting around. 

All of these things are amazing steps forward for communication and empowerment, but they also put huge amounts of trust in a single entity which will have no choice but to bow to government pressures. 

Client side cryptography where all data stored in the cloud is encrypted is the only way to prevent government snooping. It would be great to see a company focused on following google's lead on easy communication tools, but with a layer built in for customer protection that cannot be undermined by the company itself.

Whatever side you are identified yourself with, you are identifying yourself with a side that supports an evil financial system, an imperialist military system, and a corrupt bought out political system controlled by career politicians who's main focus is getting enough campaign contributions to continually be reelected - often at the expense of your rights.

Stop applying a label to yourself and think freely. 

The issues that both sides wheel out both have merit, and should be deeply considered regarding how we want our society to function. Look at the constitution and the bill of rights. The people who created these documents thought about issues that are still relevant today, and the dogma of the political parties are slowly washing away the soul of this nation.

Basically both parties hate it as it greatly reduces government programs and raises taxes.

I am not too down on the raising taxes, it is great to see a real reduction in government actually happen.

Unfortunately this is all a lot of theater. The law enacted in 1986 that forces congress to adhere to a prescribed budget (otherwise face across the board automatic cuts) has never taken effect since every year they just modify the law and adjust up the budget limit.

I guess this is always the problem when you try to write a law to control the people that can simply rewrite the law. Maybe there needs to be some designation of "super-law" which cannot be rewritten. This would basically be an amendment to the constitution, and I would love to see something wedged into there to prevent lawmakers from spending more money, though I loath to see them monkey with that document.

I think conspiracy theories are sometimes conspiracy in themselves. 

ZeroHedge put the RT as a bullet point, and feel that it requires a little comment. 

I think that the RT is nothing more than a russian news puppet show that is similar to our leaflet bombings of enemies in prior wars. Their purpose is to destabilize the US. Just like our leaflet campaigns, it is very convenient when those in power are doing horrible things, because you just need to spread the truth that suits your mission.

The RT is a fantastic source of info, but keep in mind who is pulling the strings. I am still awaiting their scathing commentary on Putin or the situation in Chechnya. 

All news sources & blogs have an agenda, or are backed by someone with an agenda. Identify that agenda, and allow the recognition of that agenda be a filter for every word they say. News is great for information, but only in the same way that the words of a poker player should be carefully considered when they are talking about their own hand.

After using mongodb for quite some time and building several systems with it, I am starting to drift back into preferring structured data in a mysql db. 

* It is reliably fast
* Building the structure of the mysql seems to help in the designing of a system
* It seems more stable

I think the second one is the biggest reason. It is a rather fuzzy thing, but I like to look at the db and see what fields are there. 

My convictions are weak here, and I will probably drift back at some later date, but I just feel that the relational db model matches well with how a web based system is designed.

Along with that, I am drifting back to PHP for web systems rather than node.js. There just is less layers of things that you need to cobble together to put up a php web site, and less points of failure. 

Perhaps I am losing my hipness. I just like my web systems to be stable, fast, and easy to develop. Counting up the number of hours of work setting up and keeping stable mongodb/node.js sites, and excluding time spent just making things that actually spit out a novel piece of html for a browser, makes me reconsider these new shiny technologies. 

Now, with that all said, there are some cases where they really shine. Node really lets you get nitty-gritty with the type of server stuff you can do (such as real-time comet connections, or just plain old tcp sockets). Mongo allows you to really dump models right into your db - goodby ORMs (and good riddance)!

But, if you want to make a website where users make requests to the server for html, and you need to store some data about the users and the results of their actions, well PHP/MySQL is still the shortest path between A & B.

## A new way to round - rand_round
@date=2012-09-08
@tags=google-plus-post
**A new way to round - rand_round**
So in grade school you are taught the basics of rounding. If the decimal portion of the number is &lt; .5 round down to the integer so 5.3 becomes 5. If it is >= .5 round up, so 5.8 becomes 6.
 
This is well and good if you are doing something that has an even distribution after the decimal point. But lets say that you are doing continuous small adjustments on a value and it is unlikely to be an evenly distributed set since the calculation for the adjustment will typically be the same.
 
An example senerio that got me thinking about this is related to a game I am working on at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://constantsail.com" class="ot-anchor bidi_isolate" jslog="10929; track:click" dir="ltr">constantsail.com</a>. Every minute 1 food is consumed for each crew member on a ship, but I want to do a smaller time slice of every 6 seconds which is 1/10 of a food per crew for that interval. Food is an integer in the db, so it must be rounded off in one way or another. If we just used the round function in mysql, and we had two crew members, I would be subtracting round(.2) ever time which comes out to zero. What I really want is it to return zero 80% of the time, and one 20% of the time, so in the long run, it still ends up being 2 food consumed for the two crew for every minute.
 
To do this I take the result of rand() which returns a value from 0 to 1 and if it is less than D (which is the decmial portion of the value we are rounding) we add 1 to the floored value of our original number, else we just floor the value.
 
The equation is:
```

function rand_round(x){
 D = x - floor(x);
 if(rand() &lt; D){
   return floor(x)+1;
 }else{
   return floor(x);
 }
}
			   
```

*Ebay's failure as an auction site*

Too often when I go to ebay now, I just find merchants filling the search results with either "buy it now" items, or auctions with too high of a starting price.

I wish they would do something about this. A simple solution would be a 5% charge of the listing price when you put something up for sale. People would then be more likely to put things up for zero, and a normal auction would happen. 

Unfortunately ebay is drifting from an auction site to just a low scale merchant site.

This was a response to a message posted from an occupy wall street support who felt the occupy movement has nothing to do with libertarians. They also were speaking about the need to regulate business:

Most libertarians are against the bail out of wall street, which I suppose the occupy wall street movement is about. 

The govt regulations on industry are usually written by industry leaders (not the common man) to solidify their monopolies by making it more difficult for new competition in the marketplace. Do you believe that bills are written with you in mind or lobbyists? Do you think legislators (aka the govt) serve you or serve those who wish to decrease financial equality?

Government solutions to economic problems are nice in theory, but the reality is that they are driven by corruption.

Do you believe that the health care bill 10 years from now will seem like a great idea? Or, do you think that 1 pound of legislation wasn't actually written (or read) by politicians with our interests in mind, but was instead written by those will rob our country blind?

Libertarians may be self interested, but we also have an understanding that everyone is self interested, and that the govt is not used to satisfy the needs of the people, but instead to rob from those who do not exercise power over it, and those who have power over it are those with the biggest check books - for the most part.

**Book review of Starship Troopers I posted on Amazon.com**

This is totally different than the movie, but only in good ways. Heinlein is a expert of political philosophy applied to science fiction and paints a world of a fascist government that is embraced by its citizens, and you can sympathise with those citizens and see how they view it in a positive light. I love a book where you can see things from outside of your own perspective and still relate to the characters. It also allows you to see the current direction our world is taking and how external military threats can shape a nation, and how the shape of the nation can help generate those external threats.

Oh, and yes, space marines go kill aliens. That is fun too. 

If you end up liking this, go pick up The Moon is a Harsh Mistress. In that, it shows how a revolution based on libertarian virtues breaks out on the moon and overthrows a repressive government. They aren't at all in the same story line, but in some ways I feel it makes a good follow up.

## Oregon Delegate Convention & Romney Camp's Dirty Tricks
@date=2012-06-24
@tags=ronpaul, politics

So of the 13 delegates, we were able to get 11 of our slate elected in the first two ballots. We also got 2 out of the three electors and the treasurer position. Then the nastiness started. 

So two more ballots were not done. This is because to move forward to each ballot, the previous ballot must be completed by all of the other districts in the state. The next ballots were for alternate delegates - which some people running as delegates would be running for if they didn't get in as a regular delegate. Since the next ballots were contingent on the results from the other districts we were forced to wait, and wait, and wait. 

Keep in mind we were the second largest district in the state, and we finished hours beforehand for the first ballots and dutifully passed on our results to the other districts. When the Romney camp discovered that we were mopping up the floor with them, they realized they had to shut this thing down. 

They stalled the voting process in their district until 5pm, when the rules stated that the meeting had to be adjourned, and did so in their district. According to the rules we were not able to continue, and so were unable to vote for any of the alternate delegates (of which I was one ). We adjourned shortly afterwards. Two other districts were able to extend their time as well, but in the end they shut down as well (being the ballots could not be voted on without the results from the rogue district).

So from here it seems that the Republican Central Committee will be the one selecting the alternate delegates. I am none-to-hopeful about them selecting myself or anyone else on the Ron Paul slate as alternates.

In the end, we took most of the seats that mattered (the main delegates). As long as they don't find a way to take those from us, I will consider it a win. 

Best of luck to the remaining states, and be ever vigilant. Opponents to liberty play dirty.

@date=2012-05-09
@tags=google-plus-post
**When we reach 21 Million Bitcoins, will their be no economic activity, and a deflation spiral?**
 #bitcoin  
I think an assumption here is 

Fixed monetary quantity = deflation.

The increase or decrease in money value is not entirely based upon scarcity. 

A major factor in inflation is monetary velocity (how much the money flows around). If all holders of bitcoin suddenly started using bitcoins for the majority of their transactions, we would face rapid inflation. 

Also, whatever equation you use to quantify the value of money goes out the window once it hits perception. How people view a currency is more important to its value than anything else. 

Yes, people might hold bitcoins for some time as the price goes up, but if it doesn't go up forever, and starts to flatline, people will want to start getting rid of it, and this will cause a feedback loop that might make it so people will jump ship as fast as they can.

In the end, without some large economic event, I think bitcoins are fairly stable, and will just get more stable over time. That means they will become a pretty piss poor investment, especially if they end up only deflating at &lt;5% annually. Investing in revenue generating businesses would end up being more lucrative. Also, investing in things that would provide immediate happiness would be more valuable. 

Only about 7200 per day are being produced right now, and I am sure speculators are already adjusting their valuations for output halving (it is not like it is a surprise). So we are looking at moving from $36000 per day to $18000 per day in "quantitate easing." With the number of people in bitcoin, I consider that to mean that for all purposes, we have practically reached the end of money production.

So here you are. The train has basically reached the $21M quantity. Look around you, because at this point, I think speculators are going to get bored soon, and move on to some other new beanie baby. We have some stuff you can buy and sell, and it makes a great currency for gambling and buying drugs. I see a super bright future in its use in games, and if the USD ever falls apart, bitcoin and precious metal holders will be laughing all the way to the bank (not to say they will be rich, but just that they have weathered a storm). Bitcoins will go up and down in value, but really I think it is pretty much in the right ballpark now. The economy will grow one storefront at a time, and hopefully it will be a boring useful part of the economy, and not a long dead fad.

I am surprised it took people this long to strap a gun to a quadrocopter. Unfortunately, FPS is right. This is the future. Though I can see a person controlling a semi-autonomous squad of them rather than just a single one.

One would be the eyes of the operator, and with a mouse he could click multiple targets and the copters would swarm attack independently. He could then click on a map to have them move to the next zones of combat, and of course fly back to the recharge vehicle automatically when needed. 

As with anything, there will be countermeasures. I am sure radio interference would be one of the first ones, hence the need for semi-autonomous operation. But I am sure, a signal will always get through. Targeting and destroying these little buggers will be a pain too, and it looks like they could be mass produced cheaply (and exploded rather than return for a recharge). In the end, you probably need to either cut off communications with the operator or eliminate the operator (if possible since this could be all the way across the world).

This technology is an obvious evolution of warfare, but I think more interesting will be the countermeasures.

They put all over this that this is conceptual design, and not actual gameplay. But I hope they make it look even a little like this as it is pretty hot.

This will require a constant internet connection as they are implementing stuff that will have economic balancing with other cities in your "region." Cool. 

I always thought that simcity should have an online mode, but not with loosely connected regions. It would be great to just have one continuous terrain that people build on. You would need to have bidding wars with neighboring cities to acquire more development zones, and perhaps incircle areas to make them more unattractive to your neighbors. Have lower taxes and suck away their citizens, and form trade agreements that help both sides. Water wars, transportation networks, federalization of areas, drug legal cities that cause spillover effects in other cities, plagues...

There are so many possibilities that I have seen them skip in previous simcities that I really hope they pursue in this one.  With an internet enabled game, you can stretch the possibilities and break out of the bubble that previous simcity games have been in.

Or they can just improve the graphics, make it less grid like, add some improvements, and make this just another iteration of a really over done idea. It will still sell like hotcakes anyway, and will be less risky than a more competitive socially oriented simcity.

I can't stand out of office auto-replies. 

I send a message to 10 people and 3 back. I don't care that you took off on friday. 

It would be great if when you send out an email you can tack on #noOOO or something like that, and the auto-reply system will not send those back. 

Or maybe reverse it and say  #yesOOO  and OOO messages will only be sent when people really want them (which in most cases will be never).

So the banks are being incentivised 63 cents on the dollar for the for every dollar of a mortgage that is forgiven. This will be paid for with tax funds.

That is huge.

If you are in forclosue is time to give the bank a call and negotiate.

**Follow everyone that someone else is following on twitter**

I opened up a second twitter account, and I wanted to follow everyone my first twitter account was following. I went to the "following" page for the first account and started clicking away, till bordom ensued. Then I did an inspect element on the follow button, and with a little jquery magic, did a quick follow of everyone. I just opened up the javascript console, and entered.
$('.js-action-follow').click();

Done!

I created a site where you can post links, videos, images, and blobs of text (html allowed).

It works much like most social news sites where visitors can vote up stories they like to the home page in various different categories. The difference is that the voting is in bitcoins in increments of 0.001 units. 80% of the bitcoins received go to the poster of the article.

Posting and voting up articles is an anonymous process, and no login is needed (also IP addresses & sessions are not recorded). For those that are into Tor, onion links are welcome and are marked with an onion icon. Hopefully this will help with the discovery of content on the onion network.

Pissed about SOPA, it will be back. Here are some better ways to keep it from coming back:

Make sure these pricks don't get reelected:

Lamar Smith (R-TX)  -- introduced the legislation
Harry Reid (D-NV) 
Howard Berman (D-CA) 
Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) 
Mary Bono Mack (R-CA) 
Steve Chabot (R-OH) 
John Conyers (D-MI) 
Ted Deutch (D-FL) 
Elton Gallegly (R-CA) 
Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) 
Timothy Griffin (R-AR) 
Dennis A. Ross (R-FL) 
Adam Schiff (D-CA) 
Lee Terry (R-NE) 


And boycott these companies that supported the legislation:

@date=2012-01-19
@tags=google-plus-post
It looks like SOPA and PIPA have likely been stopped as politicians have dropped support for it.

It was a great move for freedom, but on a more sour grapes note: where was this outpouring of popular dissent when so many non-internet freedoms have been taken away. 

It looks as though without yesterday's actions these bills had a good chance of passing. This was really a story of the internet giants stepping up to government to oppose something that would have destroyed their freedoms. They attacked the government by raising awareness of the issue to the general public which had a mutual interest in protecting these freedoms. 

And the people marched (called) on their representatives to voice their disapproval. 

The problem is that many freedoms aren't relied on by corporations in a position to raise awareness. When a bill was signed by Obama that gave the right to lock up individuals without due process, google didn't change their logo to show someone trapped in a cage. 

I am not suggesting that they should have taken a stand on that issue, as they are a corporation, and a corporation's mission is not to be a political activist (unless it has an need to be). What I am suggesting is that people need to be informed about what is going on in government. Many people thing that politics aren't interesting and don't involve them. Yet politics shape the direct reality of their day to day life. 

Laws are written about what you can say, do, and who you can associate with. Proposals are made to raise taxes, cut or add services, inflate away the value of your money, and adjust how much the government can monitor and track all forms of speech.

The internet corporations have successfully fought for their freedoms because they are informed. Individuals need to do the same.

Picture wars is a forum based game where a 2-d sidescroll style map is used. 2 or more players each use their own sprite pack armies in a turned based war game. 

Each turn, players move their units and attack things by updating the image. Whatever makes sense is considered acceptable. Along with the update of the image, text is also included in the forum post explaining what happened in the turn.

The reason was that the results for technical terms started getting more "fuzzy" (+ operator was dropped and no matter what I couldn't force it to limit results to only things that contained what I wanted)

Now I am even more hesitant to use it. Google search has been a winner due to its clean layout and generally not being biased. 

It looks like that era is over.

**Fake Amazon Reviews**

Important when looking at reviews on Amazon: click on their profiles and see what else a person reviewed.

I find a lot of reviewers are fake, and are really just sock puppets of the person selling the item.

When the person reviewing the item only ever reviewed this item, or reviewed only items from this seller, it is likely a fake.

Here is an example:

A better way to fight SOPA

GoDaddy has been a supporter of SOPA which has caused many to boycott them.

Here is an even better way to hit them in the bottom line...

Add this somewhere in your webpage (you can just stick it somewhere in the footer)
<a href="<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.namecheap.com" class="ot-anchor bidi_isolate" jslog="10929; track:click" dir="ltr">http://www.namecheap.com</a>">Domain Registration</a>

GoDaddy is #1 in google for "Domain Registration", but if enough people link to this (it doesn't take much) they will be nocked out of the coveted top spot. This will be a huge dent in their revenue stream, as I think their target audience are people that just chose the first google result. 

This is referred to as a "google bomb" and it works by the fact that search ranking is based upon the the weight of the links pointed to a page. The name of the link helps them correlate the search terms that match with the link. 

Namecheap was chosen as they have a high ranking (so they have a good chance at popping to the top) and has been vocal in being anti-SOPA. You can use the coupon code "SOPASucks" to get a discount there too. 

I just added it to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://editthis.info" class="ot-anchor bidi_isolate" jslog="10929; track:click" dir="ltr">editthis.info</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://cueflash.com" class="ot-anchor bidi_isolate" jslog="10929; track:click" dir="ltr">cueflash.com</a> (both with a page rank of 5). That will hit them in the SEOs.

@date=2011-12-22
@tags=google-plus-post
Google has been manipulating their algorithm, with the goal of making it more friendly to users.

This means it will find results that do not match all of your criteria, but are more "meaningful" ~= higher page rank.

They have also ditched the + operator (+keyword) which forces only results that contain matches for that keyword. They have added a verbatim option hidden in the left rail (you have to fold out to reveal it) which should make it so all terms must match. Also wrapping a term in quotes should also force things. 

In the end results get more fuzzy, and when you know exactly what you want, it just pisses you off.

For example, I am trying to find javascript code for calculating TrueSkill (it is an algorithm that XBox uses that is used for their ranking). 

So I type in
 +"TrueSkill" +"Javascript"
and do a verbatim search, just to be through (because every other variation still didn't get me what I want.

What do I get, some results with Javascript in it, some with TrueSkill in it, and a one with both. 

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22trueskill%22+%22javascript%22&hl=en&safe=off&tbo=1&output=search&source=lnt&tbs=li:1&sa=X&ei=MKvzTqmGEqmviQLo4dXQDg&ved=0CBUQpwUoCg&biw=1200&bih=1505" class="ot-anchor bidi_isolate" jslog="10929; track:click" dir="ltr">https://www.google.com/search?q=%22trueskill%22+%22javascript%22&hl=en&safe=off&tbo=1&output=search&source=lnt&tbs=li:1&sa=X&ei=MKvzTqmGEqmviQLo4dXQDg&ved=0CBUQpwUoCg&biw=1200&bih=1505</a>

And what do we get... success. Only the results that I want. Each only contain both results.

ddg is now my bitch when it comes to finding some specific chunk of code in a sea of unrelated crap.

Bonus points for having a search url which is not ridiculous.

It is really annoying when source code download sites don't provide a url that you can use with curl (usually it is some html redirect page that does tracking for them). 

I want to download the code onto the server. I don't want to download it locally and then scp it to the server.

After futzing with Adobe Illustrator for a while, and getting fed up, I hand coded an SVG file and imported it in. So much easier when you want to be accurate. Trying to tell the software what you want with pointing and clicking just isn't as good as typing in <polygon points="...." style="...">

I guess this would be different if I was doing a complicated graphic, but when just doing circles, squares, text, etc it just makes sense to type out what you want.

This is an easy way to give someone bitcoins, even if they don't have a bitcoin wallet. 

Simply scan the public address on the cheque, transfer bitcoins to it, and write in the amount the cheque was funded with. 

This is perfect for paying a merchant, or perhaps selling bitcoins to someone as an investment.

A user posted up content that was copyrighted, and dreamhost recieved a DMCA takedown notice. They shut my site down, without first giving me any notice (though, in their defense, it was easy to turn it back on).

I also run a UGC site on linode (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://editthis.info" class="ot-anchor bidi_isolate" jslog="10929; track:click" dir="ltr">editthis.info</a>), and had the same situtation there (except the person who made the complaint was wrong and I protected the users' contributions). Linode actually allowed me to address the issue rather than just pulling the plug.

If you are going to run a site where a user might post something that violates copyright (a forum, a blog with comments, or practically anything), and you would prefer not to have a provider that shoots first, and asks questions later, go with Linode.

So someone sent a DMCA notice to my service provider. They were complaining about content that they considered their copyright in a wiki I am hosting. It was a page about their news station WHKY TV. Looking through the history of the page, I could see that a bunch of people worked together to create the page. 

After a bunch of back and forth messages where he took a week to reply each time (and capped off each one with a legal threat), my final message to them ended with:

"Also, reply within 24 hours. I don't care how busy you are. You are
the one who is wasting my time with what I suspect is a fishing
expedition then threatening legal action. All the while I am complying
with the investigation clause in your request.

Cheers,

## code at the end of the post

What happens when you round 3.6 ---> you get 4. 

What about in a game? Should every time a player kills 3.6 of an enemy, should it be really 4? 

Probably not, but the math might have that happen all of the time. It should be that it rounds up 60% of the time. Over time, the average player would then kill 3.6 enemies, without having to deal without the sticky philosophical questions of an enemy that is 40% alive.

Here is a little function that will prevent that. (in JS, but easy to convert)

```
 //adjusts a value up or down to nearest int with a random factor 
 //based upon the decimal value. i.e. 3.2 has a 80% chance of being 3, 20% of 4 var randRound = function(num){
 var num = Number(num);
 var floor = Math.floor(num);
 var dec = num - floor;
 if(Math.random()>dec){
 return floor;
 }
 return Math.ceil(num);
 }

```




## Avoiding a deep stack of callbacks

When working with mongodb especially, but also in other cases, you can create a deep stack of calls that can get pretty ugly in javascript. 

To avoid this I created a function that will recursively go through an array of things you want to process in a callback stack.

This is what 3d should really be.

 Using the infrared camera in the Wii remote and a head mounted sensor bar (two IR LEDs), you can accurately track the location of your head and render view dependent images on the screen. This effectively transforms your display into a portal to a virtual environment. The display properly reacts to head and body movement as if it were a real window creating a realistic illusion of depth and space. By Johnny Chung Lee, Carnegie Mellon University.

I think it is a pretty awesome name, but not worth it to me to do the $10 renewal. If you want it, let me know (though keep in mind it will still cost $10 to get it).  I can transfer it to you after renewing.

If you have a search results page on your website, try to minimize the amount that users have to use the pager on those results.

Google gets away with showing only 10 results, because they are awesome at delivering what you are looking for in that first page. Your results probably aren't that successful. 

Here is a simple measure: If more than 5% of the visitors to your results page click the next button, double the number of results you show on the page. Keep doing that until the number gets below 5%.

There was a scene that really focused on the cost of a $5 milkshake. This was between two characters that probably blow plenty of money on coke and heroin.

Today, a $5 milkshake is no big deal. Heck, that is how much a coffee is (the cheapest beverage to make on earth) at *$. I wonder how expensive it would have to be today to amaze these John Travolta's character today.

The Jumpers

The year was 2016, and researchers at the CTEX2 particle accelerator lab discovered a way to slow time around a local area to near zero. Anyone within this field would feel that they jumped forward in time in a flash. 

Before long, the jumpBooth became a commercial product, retailing for a mere million dollars. NASA bought them with the idea of once again going to space and traveling longer distances without life support. People with terminal diseases bought them to perhaps jump to when they could be cured. Some people even got some money together to send a historian on a journey to tell the future what it was really like to live today. 

The ones that bought them the most though, were investors. There was someone named Warren Buffet that just popped up ever 10 years, looked around made some quick transactions and moved on. Others joined the flow into the future looking for great gains over long term investment plans. This had the effect of slowing the growth of stocks and decreasing long term returns.

As the price fell for the jumpBooth, more people could use it. During wars the peace-nicks would jump forward looking for a more peaceful world. Without any movement to rally against the wars, the wars stretched on. 

During a technological dark age where there were few advancements, the inventors and innovators began jumping and created a brain drain into the future. 

Eventually everyone could jump, and did so frequently. The weather wasn't good, jump. A plague was breaking out, jump. Not enough people around due to all the jumping, jump.

The weeds began pushing up through the highways, and the wilderness reclaimed the cities. The environment changed to become more inhospitable to a species once known as man, who never had a chance to evolve to match it. Occasionally they would flash in for a moment here and there, but they just kept pushing forward, hoping for a better time and place for themselves that only they could create.

Been researching the Cetera audial algorithm after hearing about (and experiencing) the Virtual Barber Shop for the first time. 
The technology in itself is incredible, and it surely opens an entire world of alternative entertainment and media. It's a surprise no one's really capitalised on it yet specifically for that purpose, but its use in hearing aids is probably the best use I can imagine. 

If you want to know what I'm talking about, go here:

The narrator-guy explains it in a small way, and it's just insane. 

**Important: headphones are a must!**

 You&#39;ll need headphones for this to work. Make sure there is no noise around, close your eyes, turn the volume up a little bit, hold and press headphone on your ears for better hearing, play it and enjoy this impressive audio work ( illusion ). Not a screamer not a prank! CREDITS: Finally the origin of the embedded audio clip has been found. This amazing audio clip was created by QSound Labs ( http://www.qsound.com ) as a demonstration of Binaural audio technology. See this wikipedia entry for information about binaural recordings. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binaural_recording Extra tags: barbershop barber wow omg amazing featured technology wild scary horror lovely virus lovelyvirus

_scoreTag allows you to tag your posts the same way you could using twitter #hashTags

It is has a _chromeExtension which turns a _scoreTag into a link. This allows users to quickly find other posts regarding a particular topic. 

Why not just use #hashTag? Well, google ignores the # symbol when it indexes pages for searching, so it doesn't do much good if you actually want to find posts using it.

Have you been programming in php for years and need to write some javascript, only to find you really could use a php function to solve a js problem.

Well stop before you rewrite it.

Has been a great fill in for all those times I just wished I had access to the 1M+ functions php seems to have.

I like to wrap it all in an object so I can access something like:
php.explode(',', someString);

and so it makes sense when the functions in javascript break the convention of camelCase names for php_functions.

This is a pretty unique game. 

In it you create a fleet and send it into battle, but the catch is that you don't control anything once play begins. 

Most of the actual interaction you have with the game is tweaking the ships, and you can do it in extreme detail. This is basically where you grit your teeth over. 

It has single player, plus multiplayer, but you don't have to be online to have your fleets fight it out.

So my 3 year old is totally into video games (in particular a game on the wii called Excite Truck).

This game and a bunch of games on the iphone that he likes has led me to one conclusion.

Menus suck (especially if you can't read). 

What would be best is a big Go button that is green and flashing. You press it, and whatever level, weapon, ship, car, gravity level, or whatever is just randomized. Finish your mission or die and you get another go button. 

Below the go button can be Campaign mode, Custom, Settings, etc. I like tweaking out things and fiddling too, but always give the option of Go.

@date=2011-08-25
@tags=google-plus-post
I am working on a programming game where you control an army of robots via a web api. 

You can send orders to robots, or you can install javascript code in robots, and when they are out of communications range from your command center, they can use that code to work autonomously. 

The robots will be the typical variety of units that you would expect in an rts game (submarines, tanks, infantry, etc). They will run on fuel which will need to be transported to the front line by workers (which will have their own scripts to handle logistics). 

Communications will be key and setting up relay towers to send new messages and code to distant soldiers will be important (otherwise they will be in the dark, and you won't know what they are up to). Sending and receiving messages will cost fuel. 

The game will have no graphical user interface. A companion project is also set up which will allow people to create the interface and modify it to their liking using html5/javascript/etc etc.

The initial api stuff can be seen here:
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://rts-api.com:2000/help/api_options" class="ot-anchor bidi_isolate" jslog="10929; track:click" dir="ltr">http://rts-api.com:2000/help/api_options</a>

If you are interested in getting involved in the development of this game, let me know. (This is not a job, there will likely be no profit here)

Technology involved: Node.js + express + mongodb

If you just want to do the client end stuff, you will need to know jQuery and be able to work with JSON.

Going to see The Protomen tomorrow night. Totally psyched.

 The first music video of The Protomen. For more info. visit http://www.protomen.com/ [Lyrics] Narrator: No one was left who could remember how it had happened, how the world had fallen under darkness. At least no one who would do anything. No one who would oppose the robots. No one who would challenge their power, or so Dr. Wily believed... Twenty Floors above the dark streets of the city, Dr. Light lived in a run-down tenement. An eccentric and brilliant man. Light was a loner, a thinker, a man of ideas. Ideas forbidden in Wily&#39;s society. The society for which he worked. The society in which he lived. The society that he would set free. And so Light worked, far into the night, when the watchful eyes of Wily&#39;s robots weren&#39;t upon him. He&#39;d set his skillful hands to the task of creating a device to bring about a change, to create a machine to bring freedom, to create a man to save the world. Twelve years Light worked and on a cold night in the year 200X, Protoman was born. A perfet man, an unbeatable machine, hell-bent on destroying every evil standing between man and freedom, built for one purpose, to destroy Wily&#39;s army of evil robots. Ready, willing, prepared to fight Cutman Gutsman Elecman Bombman Fireman Iceman Proto Fireman: Attack! Narrator: Fight. And as the smoke cleared. Wiley rose above the countless robots remaining. Protoman was wounded, low on energy, struggling to remain standing as Wily ordered the final attack. The death of Protoman. The crowd had gathered there to watch him fall, to watch their hopes destroyed. They watched them beat him, they watched them break him, they watched his last defense deployed. There was not a man among them who would let himself be heard. But from the crowd, from the collective fear, arose these broken words: We are the dead We are the dead Human Choir: What have we done? Narrator: We are the dead Human CHoir: What will we do? Narrator: We are the dead Human Choir: Where will we turn? Narrator: We are the dead Human Choir: Is there nothing we can do? Narrator: We are the dead Human Choir: How did it come to this? Narrator: We are the dead Human Choir: How did we go so wrong? Narrator: We are the dead Human Choir: We are the dead

I am looking to start a postal game (where you mail stamped letters to each-other) where the adjudication is done via the web (there is no game master). I set up a game that starts in 6 days at the link. Join up, and send me an email with your postal mailing address when the game starts, along with your nation. I will send the mailing addresses to everyone in the game. My email address with google is robkohr.

Speedcrunch is a great calculator application that is available on all major OSes

It works very much like a scientific calculator, with variables and complex expressions. It also gives you updates to the calculation as you are typing.
Though it is seems complex, it is my favorite to use even for the most basic of calculations. It is fast and the interface is simple to use.
Oh, and it is free:

Due to really poor sales in the app store (kinda expected since it was just an astroids clone) space rocks is now free. When I get around to it, I will post up the source code on github. It was written with JS using the canvas element for drawing. It was bundled into an iOS app using phonegap.

If you have an urge to hack on it, just post a comment here, and I will post up the source earlier (right now it is a low priority).

 Michael Fishbach, co-founder of The Great Whale Conservancy (GWC), narrates his encounter with a young humpback whale entangled in local fishing nets. At first, the animal appeared to be dead, yet Fishbach investigated and quickly discovered that the poor creature was tangled in a fishing net. The humans had to act fast; what began as a tragedy soon became a thrilling rescue as Fishbach and his crew labored to free the young whale. The entire encounter was caught on videotape and later narrated by Fishbach himself. This young whale knows how to show appreciation by treating them to a magnificent aerial spectacle after it was finally freed.

 *DISCLAIMER: Dear movie studio and Benny Benassi- this video is not intended for commercial use. It is simply a side project created for the fun of it. I like apes and monkeys, I like classic movies like this one, I like dance music, I like Benny Benassi, and I used to like glowsticks when I was 19... so I made this video. If the usage of this footage or music for this artistic expression causes any issues with you, please contact me directly (info found easily at www.bradhasse.com) and I&#39;ll take it down. But ever since this idea popped into my head, I couldn&#39;t help but try to make it for the fun of it to see what it would look like if Charlton Heston found a few glowsticks, turntables, and an insatiable urge to dance. Since I work with some amazing graphics people, we decided to just give it a go. This is a result of that collaboration. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The footage is from the original 1968 &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; The music is a medley of songs from Benny Benassi Presents The Biz- &quot;Hypnotica&quot; album (Get Loose, Satisfaction, Time, I Wanna Touch Your Soul) Directed, Edited, Concept by Brad Hasse www.bradhasse.com Visual Effects and Design by EP*Vision -Maryam Parwana -Brian Walsh www.epvision.tv East Pleasant Pictures www.eastpleasant.com

## cueFlash now on Slicehost
@date=2009-11-30
@tags=constantsun-blogger-post, cueflash

After being on Dreamhost for a long time, I have switched for Slicehost. They have great uptime, cheaper prices, and allows you to do more geeky things with your webserver.  
  
This isn't a big jab against Dreamhost though. I am still a big user of them, but their VPS service doesn't give me the configuration ease that I need. Too many times I am harassing their customer service to do X, where X would have been something I could do in 5 minutes with root access. If I were a more basic user (as I used to be) they would be golden, and most of my requests would go against serving basic users.  
  
I will slowly be pulling bits and pieces of other sites (such as editthis.info and constantsail) over to slicehost, and then just using dreamhost for subversion and domain registration management.

## Editthis.info upgrade
@date=2009-11-30
@tags=constantsun-blogger-post, editthisinfo

Editthis.info has gone through a major upgrade over the last week. It has been moved to a new database system (mysql->sqlite) and has been upgraded from mediawiki 1.5.5 to 1.15.1. This is basically a 3 year jump in versions.  
  
Some of the reasons for the upgrade:  
*Stability - The massive MySQL db has reached its scaling limit  
*Security - More up to date usually is more secure  
*Extensibility - Many extensions that I would like to add were not available in the older mediawiki  
*Portability - With the ability to use sqlite with the new mediawiki codebase, I can easily move wikis and their databases (sqlite databases are single files) from one server to another. I may be adding a feature where you can download your wiki and host it elsewhere or on a flash drive.  
*Features - There has been many subtle changes over the years that I wanted to catch up on.  
  
I probably have about 5 other bullet points. The hesitation has been partly due to the complexity in making the transition. The other reason was that until recently the sqlite support has been very much in beta.  
  
The change upgrade has not been smooth. I have had web server config issues, database overloading issues (trying to export too much at once), and database syntax issues (the database systems use slightly different syntax which has caused many problems).  
  
Most of the wikis are now imported correctly, but there are plenty that have errors or no content. I am revisiting them and seeing why they didn't transfer correctly. I am suspecting it is just syntax issues. If your wiki is not working ... DON'T PANIC. The original that I am working off has been untouched, and it is just a matter of finessing it so that it translates correctly. If your wiki has problems, please post the url to the wiki here:  
[http://editthis.info/wiki/?title=Wikis_that_are_broken&action=edit](https://www.blogger.com/#)  
  
Other things that are missing but will be added in the next week:  
*Control panel to manage logo, wiki title, and permissions  
*Cookie error when you log in (it shows the error, but really the login worked)  
*Create wiki and create wiki page not available

## Character encodings for different languages

@tags=constantsun-blogger-post, editthisinfo

Editthis.info now handles foreign characters properly (just tested cyrillic and french).  
  
For those that are a little geeky, it seems that the php function htmlentities doesn't have a multibyte string version.


## Server Errors
@date=2009-04-27
@tags=constantsun-blogger-post, editthisinfo

There have been a lot of server errors recently, and they are the result of system resources being overwhelmed (using up system memory and processor).

I suspect that this is due to another app I have been working on - a real time web game called constantsail.com.

I am now setting up a separate server for the that game so that it's performance does not effect editthis.info. I expect it will be set up within the next 48 hours, and hopefully this resolves the issues.

Thanks,
Rob

Update

This problem has been resolved and you should not see any more server errors relating to this problem. The app has been moved to another server.


## EDI attacked
@date=2009-04-16
@tags=constantsun-blogger-post, editthisinfo
It seems that editthis.info was attacked by a distributor of malware. I have reverted the site code that was modified and removed the offending code they added (they add iframe tags that make it so when you visit editthis.info, you were also visiting their site in the background).  
  
I have since changed the passwords on the servers, made a further backup of all data, and am switching the site to a separate account in case there is a compromise that still exists in the current account.  
  
In the last 24 hours since the attack, google has labeled editthis.info as a malware site, and I have requested a rescan of the site since it has been cleaned up.  
  
I am uncertain as to the vector of the attack, so I am taking a number of simultaneous paths to close down possible holes.  
  
If you would like to help, a great help would be to do a view source on any editthis wiki you use for the next couple days. If you see a hidden iframe on the page, just report it here:

## A new way to round - rand_round
@date=2008-11-28
@tags=blogger-post, coding

So in grade school you are taught the basics of rounding. If the decimal portion of the number is < .5 round down to the integer so 5.3 becomes 5. If it is >= .5 round up, so 5.8 becomes 6.

This is well and good if you are doing something that has an even distribution after the decimal point. But lets say that you are doing continuous small adjustments on a value and it is unlikely to be an evenly distributed set since the calculation for the adjustment will typically be the same.

An example senerio that got me thinking about this is related to a game I am working on at constantsail.com. Every minute 1 food is consumed for each crew member on a ship, but I want to do a smaller time slice of every 6 seconds which is 1/10 of a food per crew for that interval. Food is an integer in the db, so it must be rounded off in one way or another. If we just used the round function in mysql, and we had two crew members, I would be subtracting round(.2) ever time which comes out to zero. What I really want is it to return zero 80% of the time, and one 20% of the time, so in the long run, it still ends up being 2 food consumed for the two crew for every minute.

To do this I take the result of rand() which returns a value from 0 to 1 and if it is less than D (which is the decimal portion of the value we are rounding) we add 1 to the floored value of our original number, else we just floor the value.

The equation is:

```
function rand_round(x){
 D = x - floor(x);
 if(rand()&lt;D){
   return floor(x)+1;
 }else{
   return floor(x);
 }
}
```

## Head and tail - super large outputs and inputs
@date=2008-10-09
@tags=blogger-post, coding

If ever you are dealing with a really large file in head (1GB+) and you need to grab a large segment of it (such as half the file), don't use -n option to get lines. Instead, do ls -l to find the the size of the file in bytes, figure out how many bytes you need (perhaps a portion of the of the total bytes), and then call head -c THE_AMOUNT.  
  
The reason is, I discovered that if you try and do it by line count, head needs to read through the file and find ever new line marker before outputing. This locked up a pretty powerful machine for over a day, and still didn't output. Using byte count was done in a a minute.  
  
UPDATE:  
So one of the problems I am having is that head really doesn't start outputing until it is finished, so I create a php program do output the top portion of a file:

## Image upload issues
@date=2008-07-06
@tags=constantsun-blogger-post, editthisinfo  

So [Dreamhost](https://www.dreamhost.com/) recently locked out creation of new files on the account that hosts editthis.info. It turns out that that account had 250,000+ files, and huge file systems have been a problem for them regarding stability. Almost all of the files were in the image upload directory.  
  
The problem is mediawiki creates a large number of directories, thumbnails, and archive files for every image uploaded. Many of the directories it creates are actually empty, and every directory in linux is really just a file.  
  
I went into the image storage location and ran the command:  

  
 nohup  find -depth -type d -empty -exec rmdir {} \;&  

  
Which deleted all empty directories, which brought me back under quota, but it won't be long before file count gets to a point where real files will have to be deleted... so I am blocking image uploads for right now.  
  
The solution I am looking at is possibly making image uploads a premium service only, and just charging a small cost for this. So many users create wikis on EDI, upload a few images, and then stop using the site. This will make it so those users don't have an impact on the usage, and the more heavier users most likely won't mind paying a few bucks to host their images.  
  
As always, if you ever want you can host images elsewhere, and then include them in your pages. You simply put the url to the image in your page, and it automatically shows up there.

## Transfering old wikis
@date=2008-06-08
@tags=constantsun-blogger-post, editthisinfo  

Some of the wikis still reside on the previous server. There is now a transfer system in place. Simply go to your wiki's url and it will ask you if you want to transfer. Click the link and it will add you to the transfer queue.

If the transfer queue gets stuck (no wikis are disappearing off the queue after an hour) feel free to send me an email (account robkohr and I use gmail). It was hacked together the other night, and sometimes needs a little push.

## Editthis.info downtime
@date=2008-04-06
@tags=constantsun-blogger-post, editthisinfo

Editthis.info will be down from Friday May 23rd to roughly Friday May 30th. My family and I are moving from New Jersey to San Francisco, California, and it will take about a week before the server is set up out there. My goal is to have it set up in 5 days, but I think 7 is more realistic.

I will rush and push to get this set up immediately, and I am sorry for any inconvenience this causes.

Thanks,
Rob



UPDATES:
This will be a partial downtime. I am transferring some of the wikis with the highest traffic to a dreamhost private server, and moving the domain temporarily to point to that server. Unfortunately all of the wikis cannot be transfered and will be down for the week. These are the wikis that are currently being transfered in the order that they will be transferred:
'choose_your_own_adventure', 'scp_wiki', 'code_wiki', 'londonbirders', 'timesplitterswiki', 'psy3241', 'psy3242', 'bs01_game_team_', 'bloggerhacks', 'elimine', 'rickyrab', 'superdickery', 'vandalpedia', 'glitches', 'runewiki', 'sonar', 'kaiserreich', 'charas_project', 'ben10versepedia', 'usgs', 'jtv_wiki', 'sotf_wiki', 'dxx', 'cecilia', 'undertherainbow',
'top_trumps', 'inselkampf', 'flab', 'egs_mayhem', '20803', 'sandboxwiki', 'expanding_your_horizons', 'bidoof', 'kokorodatabase',
'deathmenwalking', 'pornopedia', 'wormpedia', 'wolfapedia', 'fat', 'wikiventure', 'hanfburgwiki', 'cod', 'roach_busters', 'super_formula', 'ms_paint_brawl', 'banarte', 'dexnet',

This is based upon google analytics for count of unique vistors. The rest of the wikis will be back up by the end of next week.

## cueFlash version 2 is here!
@date=2008-04-06
@tags=constantsun-blogger-post, cueflash

The new version of cueflash is now out. It has been rewritten from the ground up with the following goals:  
*Easier to add features to - my previous version was pretty poorly coded  
*Decks are no longer copied when imported by new users - this created a bloated db  
*People can edit each other's decks, making the system more wiki like  
  
There are lots of other features I have planned, so stay tuned. This is just the first iteration.  
  
All of the data from the prior system has been imported into the newest version. You can still access the old version at http://old.cueflash.com , but keep in mind that it isn't being maintained and nothing you add to it will be imported into the new version of [cueFlash](https://www.blogger.com/#).  
  
Thanks!

## EditThis.info .... fast
@date=2008-02-11
@tags=constantsun-blogger-post, editthisinfo
The network seems to be back up to speed. I am still going to moving off the current ISP, as I haven't been happy with their service recently.

## EditThis.info .... sloooowww
@date=2008-02-11
@tags=constantsun-blogger-post, editthisinfo

I am currently research new ISPs since recently it has had intermittent slowness/outages. I didn't really have a problem with them when they were out for a power outage, or a downed line, or a nearby transformer bursting into flame. That is just the way the network crumbles. Now it just seems to be random and frequent. Obviously their success in signing up new customers has led to me losing customers as their network gets saturated.  
  
Current options I am looking into:  
*Signing up with a new ISP. Most seem to be more expensive for what I want to do and/or provide slower outbound bandwidth  
*Moving back to a web hosting company, except dedicated  
**This would be more expensive, but may be worth it in the long time as I am looking to host more products and they will be more relyable  
**I will have to do a rewrite of editthis.info so my tweaks play nicer on another companies server... this may be good since ETI is in desperate need of an upgrade.  
  
In the end it comes to a cost/time issue.  
C)EDI makes just enough in ad revenue to support its current setup, and dedicated hosting would put it in the red. There is a lot of free wiki hosts out there, and I don't know if charging a premium would really increase revenue enough to make up the difference  
T)The system would have to be revamped to both upgrade it and to move it to most servers.  
  
In the end, I think rewriting it will be the best plan. I am not satisfied with its current lack of portability and a number of structural issues. I also admit I am a better programmer than a sysadmin, and it is better to hand this off to be hosted by professionals. I expect to have cueflash out the door by the end of the month (another project I felt needed a rebuild) and after that I am going to try my second crack at rebuilding EDI.

## Politics And Small-Fry smashing in Massive Multiplayer games
@date=2007-11-26
@tags=blogger-post

Inselkampf is a game of diplomacy pretending to be a game of war. It mimics real politics in many ways. Small nations get trampled on so that the big get bigger, and the big nations have continual face offs that lead to few actual conflicts. When conflict occurs between big nations, there are massive casualties on both sides, lending itself to more future diplomacy to avoid such conflicts. In the end it is just a battle of who can be the most powerful without any direct conflict.  
  
The problem is also inherent in all games of this nature. It is a massive multiplayer game where players join all the time and those who have been most active and join the earliest get a huge advantage. The losses of the big players going against each other is not worth the rewards and so the little guy gets trampled upon. If you took a game like StarCraft or some similar pure war game, and made it continuous and where thousands of players could join at any time, you would end up with the same thing.  
  
You can even reduce it down to a 3 player war game. The usually result is the two players will team up against the weaker one, and whoever gets the most out of the deal will end up winning the final 1v1.  
  
When you get enough players together, and put them at pure competition to each other, politics will always be the end result, as the one who gets the most players/power on their side will be the winner.  
  
The only games where you will see a complete lack of politics is 1v1 games, and games where working together doesn't help each individual player. Poker is an example of that, but even then, if there was some sort of secret communications allowed, probably there would be a similar situation.  
  
So this is a common problem in wargame design. The only solutions I can see if you were to design something is to limit how much players can work together, but that really is not much of a solution. Crippling players abilities to bake a game concept work is odious.  
  
So lets start with a simple goal: make big players fight each-other rather than small fries.  
  
One thing is to spread the world out so that the cost of traveling to the small fries gets larger as they join. This still doesn't help the infrequent player who joined early, but if they get knocked out early, they join the small fries off in the distance.  
  
Another way to help the small fries, is to give them a military boost upon joining. So lets say the current average number of fighters per player is 1000k. When a new player joins they get that many units. This could also be set to the median if some players are enormous compared to others.  
  
You could also hurt the players that have large stockpiles, by causing soldiers to die out if they are not used after a certain amount of time. A similar way to do this is to increase the cost of expanding. Civ4 does this with maintenance costs for far away cities and when you have too many cities.  
  
Both the helping out of small players and the hurting of large players also have problems. It makes it so the fun tapers off for big players who can't maintain growth. Giving bonuses to small players creates an inflation factor where troops become worth less and less, and also new players will have huge armies that may be unmanageable until they learn the game better.  
  
None of these tweaks will effect political structures that are formed to consolidate power, but only effect the small fry clobbering by individual players. Small coalitions of players will still be weaker compared to larger ones, and consolidations will still happen as the smaller alliances of players cluster together to make themselves not so much of a target.  
  
I suppose this problem is as old as man, and probably older (multi-cellular vs single-cellular). A cluster of players working together will always crush the smaller players. The strong will always crush the weak. Any game design that goes against these principles will require endless hacks and tweaks to stamp them out, and the end effect may be a game that isn't much fun. The reason is that if the strong can't crush the weak, the weak will never aspire to be the strong.

NewX = (OldX*Cos(ThetaY)) + (OldZ*Sin(ThetaY))

(Copy NewZ and NewX into OldZ and OldX)

NewX = (OldX*Cos(ThetaZ)) - (OldY*Sin(ThetaZ))  ** Z axis rotation **
NewY = (OldY*Cos(ThetaZ)) + (OldX*Sin(ThetaZ))

## Dolphin Dream

Had a crazy dream where I was preparing to climb up the cliff face of a cove. After stopping at a little wooden shack that rented out the climbing equipment I headed down to the water. It was a beautiful blue and it was cold and refreshing. The cove was a deep lake that was surrounded by huge cliffs, and at the end was an opening out into the ocean. I was supposed to climb into the water and swim to the area where you climb up. When I got in the water I looked down and an orca swam up to me with is mouth open and I could see his teeth. Everyone in the group including me was scared that it was about to attack, but it stopped and I petted its head and it was happy. It stuck out its tongue and I petted that too and it was all smooth and slippery. Then a porpoise came up and I petted it too. It was a pretty happy dream.

I just started a movie making group. I am pulling people together through
craig's list and using yahoo groups as a forum. I also set up this
site: http://moviemakers.robkohr.com

I figure this will be a fun hobby to start on. I always loved watching
movies, I figure it might be intresting to make some.

### Updates:

#### June 1st 2024 We've moved
After having boardgames at Union Square for the last couple years, we decided to change locations. Though the location was great, their reduced Saturday hours, leading to the closing up at 9pm last month, means that it just doesn't work for us anymore. 

Our new home is at the Regent Chinese Restaurant & Bar at:
3353 Washington Way, Longview, WA 98632

They have a bar which is pretty popular, and are open till late at night, and even keep cooking pretty late so we can get some yummy Chinese food. 

When you pull in, enter the building on the left where the bar is, proceed past the bar, and in the billiard room, there is door on the left which leads to a room which the entertainment director has set up for us to play.

We will be keeping the time the same: 9pm the first Saturday of the month (AKA tomorrow :) ) 

See you all there.
