        <p>This came from a dream, I have cats, just changed the litters before bed, and I love the movie Hot Tub Time Machine.</p>
<p>In the dream, me and a bunch of friends discover that a cat litter box can send you to a parallel universe (it might have also possibly traveled through time a bit). </p>
<p>This presen...</p>

        <p>Had a crazy dream where I was preparing to climb up the cliff face of a cove. After stopping at a little wooden shack that rented out the climbing equipment I headed down to the water.
