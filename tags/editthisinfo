        <p>I did a fix on editthis.info yesterday. It was running super slow, and I found that some ip addresses were banging the hell out of it. One was trying to connect to login.live.com or something like that from microsoft. Another one kept requesting a weird string of escape characters. Both had no us...</p>

        <p>Editthis.info has gone through a major upgrade over the last week. It has been moved to a new database system (mysql-&gt;sqlite) and has been upgraded from mediawiki 1.5.5 to 1.15.1. This is basically a 3 year jump in versions.  </p>

        <p>Editthis.info now handles foreign characters properly (just tested cyrillic and french).  </p>
<p>For those that are a little geeky, it seems that the php function htmlentities doesn&#39;t have a multibyte string version.</p>

        <p>It seems that editthis.info was attacked by a distributor of malware. I have reverted the site code that was modified and removed the offending code they added (they add iframe tags that make it so when you visit editthis.info, you were also visiting their site in the background).  </p>

My goal is to have it set up in 5 days, but I think 7 is more realistic.</p>
