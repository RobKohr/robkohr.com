        <p>Well, I started hitting walls with 20 reps for arms. It just is hard to get to 20 at the limits of what my arms can do, but using rep/weight calculations of the higher amount for 15 reps, I am able to achieve and upgrade my weights, even when I have been stuck for weeks at the limits of what I ca...</p>

        <p>So I have been doing two workout days for a while, and each one takes nearly an hour, and it becomes hard to get myself to be motivated to do it, it isn&#39;t a daily routine, and trying to fit in that big of a time block can be challenging during the day.</p>
<p>I thought about it a bunch, as this is the ...</p>

        <p>I started doing a slight tweak to my workout routine. </p>
<p>I do 1 set per exercise, and push to do 20 reps of that set. If I don&#39;t make it, I rest for 30 seconds and try to squeeze out some more, and repeat until I hit 20 with minimal rest.  </p>
<p>I write down the weight and the number of reps of my f...</p>

        <p>I have been working out using a google spreadsheet to track workouts. I aim to do a 20 rep max each week for each exercise that is slightly above the previous week. So far, it has lead to a nice continuous improvement... assuming I don&#39;t ever skip weeks. Each time I skip more than 2 weeks it push...</p>
